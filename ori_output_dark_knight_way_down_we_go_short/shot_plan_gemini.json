      "overall_theme": "A visceral, high-octane celebration of Batman's dominance through brutal combat and mechanical power. The selected scenes showcase the Dark Knight's physical supremacy—his relentless hand-to-hand brutality, precision takedowns, and the thunderous roar of the Tumbler as he conquers Gotham's chaos. Each sequence emphasizes raw kinetic energy: punches, kicks, vehicle pursuits, and explosive confrontations that capture the punishing, unstoppable force that defines Batman's night vigilante. The montage builds through escalating action beats, culminating in iconic imagery of Batman standing victorious over defeated foes.",
      "narrative_logic": "The scene selection mirrors the song's dramatic arc—opening with quieter but tension-filled moments (the Tumbler's arrival), building into intense combat encounters (parking garage fight, building takedowns), rising through explosive vehicle sequences (high-speed chases, Tumbler dominance), and climaxing with triumphant/iconic imagery (Batcycle escape, rooftop victories). The music's repetitive descending motif syncs perfectly with Batman's methodical, precision-based fighting style—each hit deliberate, each takedown earned. The gospel-tinged vocals provide an almost mythic quality to Batman's dominance, elevating street-level brutality into something legendary.",
      "emotion": "Triumphant, overwhelming power, intimidating dominance. The emotional tone conveys an unstoppable force—Batman as a living weapon who doesn't just fight crime but dominates it. There's menace in his precision, exhilaration in his speed, and pure catharsis in his violence. The mood is darkly celebratory: watching chaos met with overwhelming, surgical force.",
