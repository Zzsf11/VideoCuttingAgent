      "overall_theme": "A chaotic and intense montage that captures the Joker's anarchic nature, showcasing his unpredictable violence, psychological manipulation, and escalating confrontations with Gotham's forces. The selected scenes progress from calculated criminal planning to full-blown urban chaos, embodying the Joker's philosophy of proving that civilization is thin veneer over primal chaos.",
      "narrative_logic": "The scenes sync with the music's building intensity from sparse to anthemic: Opening with the bank heist establishes the Joker's strategic chaos (sparse intro), escalating through increasingly violent confrontations including the hospital takeover and police massacre (building tension), culminating in the ferry experiment and final confrontation where the Joker pushes Gotham to its moral breaking point (full-band climax). The progression mirrors the music's descending melodic motif by showing the Joker systematically dismantling order scene by scene.",
      "emotion": "Unhinged, menacing, anarchic, and darkly theatrical - capturing the Joker's manic energy and joyful destruction while maintaining an undercurrent of genuine threat. The emotional tone oscillates between black comedy and genuine horror, reflecting how the Joker makes chaos feel entertaining yet terrifying.",
