1
00:01:00,720 --> 00:02:41,300
my garden. Only before breakfast? You are in hell, leecherman. And I am the devil. You're

2
00:02:43,530 --> 00:03:47,970
not the devil. Protection! Protection! Protection for them! Are you so desperate to fight criminals

3
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,030
that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time? Actually, there were seven

4
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

5
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,430
How do you know my name?

6
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,390
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear.

7
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,810
No matter how deeply he chooses to sink.

8
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,210
Who are you?

9
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,890
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Raz Al Ghul,

10
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,510
a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

11
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,320
A man who can offer you a path.

12
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,740
At least you think I need a path.

13
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,910
Someone like you is only here by choice.

14
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,470
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity,

15
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,680
but whatever your original intentions, you have become truly lost.

16
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,200
On what path, then? Ra's al Ghul, or...

17
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,260
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil,

18
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,690
and wishes to serve true justice.

19
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,150
The League of Shadows.

20
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,620
The Vigilantes.

21
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,220
No, no, no. The Vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

22
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,240
He can be destroyed, or locked up.

23
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:12,390
But, you're more than just a man if you devote yourself to an idea.

24
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,490
And if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely.

25
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,760
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,270
Tomorrow you will be released.

27
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,950
If you are bored of brawling with petty thieves and want to achieve something,

28
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,230
there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.

29
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,270
Pick one of these flowers.

30
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,790
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain,

31
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,470
You may find what you were looking for in the first place.

32
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,290
And?

33
00:05:44,970 --> 00:09:02,990
You laid the fears on others.

34
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,010
Ready to begin.

35
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,990
I stand.

36
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,030
Death does not wait for you to be read.

37
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,620
Death is not considerate warfare.

38
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,950
And make no mistake.

39
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,990
Here you face death.

40
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,810
You did so.

41
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,330
I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.

42
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,470
Very good, sir.

43
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,390
I'm very sorry, sir.

44
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,410
Don't worry, it's fine.

45
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,050
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

46
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,630
And why did we fall, Bruce?

47
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,930
so we can learn to pick ourselves up.

48
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,710
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

49
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,470
They were afraid of you.

50
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,850
Afraid of who?

51
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,350
All creatures feel fear.

52
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,130
Even the scary ones?

53
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,070
Especially the scary ones.

54
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,690
I got something to show you.

55
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,730
It's time to get up.

56
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,480
Maybe.

57
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,610
We're going back to bed.

58
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,210
Did you build this train, Dad?

59
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,820
Gotham's been good to our family.

60
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,020
But the city's been suffering.

61
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,350
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

62
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,750
So we built a new, cheap public transportation system to unite the city.

63
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,610
And at the center, Wayne Tower.

64
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,740
Is that where you work?

65
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,520
No, I work at the hospital.

66
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,740
I lead the running of our company to much better men.

67
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,580
Better?

68
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,480
Well, more interested men.

69
00:12:05,020 --> 00:13:23,590
I just needed some fresh air.

70
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,350
A little bit of opera goes a long way.

71
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,490
Right, Bruce?

72
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,870
Come on. Let's go.

73
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,350
Wallace.

74
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:38,970
Joyce.

75
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,030
You're a bastard.

76
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,810
That's fine.

77
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,310
Bastard.

78
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,490
Take it easy.

79
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,590
Take it easy.

80
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,940
Here you go.

81
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,130
It's fine.

82
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,220
Now just take it and go.

83
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,440
I said you were...

84
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,800
Shut up!

85
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,060
Is this your father's?

86
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,360
We'll be watching the Empire.

87
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,980
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

88
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,430
It was my fault, Alfred.

89
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,150
I made the deed to fear.

90
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,010
If my handguns skip...

91
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,210
It was nothing that you did.

92
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,220
it was him.

93
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,880
So what?

94
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:03,730
Do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

95
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,650
My anger outweighs my guilt.

96
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,329
Come.

97
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,400
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

98
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,319
I will teach you to confront it

99
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,660
and to face the truth.

100
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,099
You know how to fight six men.

101
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,140
We can teach you how to engage 600.

102
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,710
You know how to disappear.

103
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,870
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

104
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,030
Invisible?

105
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,920
Abhi!

106
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:43,670
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

107
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,060
Always mind your surroundings.

108
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,020
Ninjutsu employs explosive powders.

109
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,940
As weapons?

110
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,100
Or distractions.

111
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,340
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

112
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,300
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

113
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,910
The young one, then!

114
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,610
Who is he?

115
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,370
He was a farmer and he tried to take his neighbors land and became a murderer now he is a prisoner

116
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:30,130
What'll happen to him justice crime cannot be tolerated criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding

117
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,950
Your parents death was not your fault

118
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,340
It was your father's.

119
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,930
Change the fact that your father failed to act.

120
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,210
The man had a gun.

121
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,090
Would that stop you?

122
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,110
I've had training.

123
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,210
But training is nothing.

124
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,650
The will is everything.

125
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,790
The will to act.

126
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:39,160
You haven't beaten me.

127
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,340
You've sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

128
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,920
Rub your chest.

129
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,050
Your arms will take care of themselves.

130
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,270
You're stronger than your father.

131
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,290
You didn't know my father.

132
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,430
But I know the rage that drives you.

133
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,990
That impossible anger strangling the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins.

134
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,970
And one day you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed.

135
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,670
So you'd be spared your pain.

136
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:36,150
I wasn't always here in the mountains, taken from me.

137
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,190
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency who must be killed.

138
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,110
There must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

139
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,740
Your anger gives you great power.

140
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,390
But if you let it, it will destroy you,

141
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,370
as it almost did me.

142
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,850
What stopped it?

143
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:55,890
Vengeance.

144
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
That's no help to me.

145
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,050
Why could you not avenge your parents?

146
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,600
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir,

147
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,480
or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

148
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm not heading back at all.

149
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,520
You don't like it, eh?

150
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,530
I like it fine. They just don't feel the same way.

151
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,050
I've prepared the master bedroom.

152
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,520
No. My room will be fine.

153
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,680
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

154
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,660
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

155
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,270
Your father is dead, Master Wayne.

156
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,580
This place is a mausoleum. If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

157
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,300
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

158
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,180
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.

159
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:54,000
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in our world.

160
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,840
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

161
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,010
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

162
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,390
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

163
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,350
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

164
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,730
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

165
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,840
Haven't given up on me yet?

166
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,100
Never.

167
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,450
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

168
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,040
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?

169
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,740
We'll have as thy heart, I guess.

170
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,240
Never used to stop us anyway.

171
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,180
No, it didn't. How's your mom?

172
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,020
She misses this place.

173
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,240
So do I.

174
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:26,980
Yeah.

175
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,470
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

176
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,990
Now there's only Alfred.

177
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,710
And you?

178
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,510
I'm not staying, Rachel.

179
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,930
You're just back for the hearing.

180
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,560
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

181
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,610
Someone at this proceeding should stand for my parents.

182
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,190
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

183
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,350
What Chill did is unforgivable.

184
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,930
Then why's your boss letting him go?

185
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,120
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

186
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,610
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

187
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,890
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

188
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,450
I cannot let that pass, and I need you to understand that, please.

189
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,090
The Depression hit working people like Mr. Chill hardest of all.

190
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,910
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

191
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,630
And given the 14 years already served, as well as its extraordinary level of cooperation

192
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,990
with one of this office's most important investigations,

193
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,830
we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

194
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,890
Mr. Chill?

195
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,050
Not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

196
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,170
I'm sure I was desperate.

197
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,630
Like a lot of people back then, but they don't change what they did.

198
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,830
I gather there's a member of the Wayne family here today.

199
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,710
Has he got anything to say?

200
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,820
We don't need to see this.

201
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,130
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted on making the hearing public.

202
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,750
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

203
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,290
Maybe I should be thanking them.

204
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,250
You don't mean that.

205
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,550
What if I do, Rachel?

206
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,710
My parents deserve justice.

207
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,030
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

208
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,410
Sometimes they're the same.

209
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,030
No, they're never the same, Bruce.

210
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,550
Justice is about harmony.

211
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,950
Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

212
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,810
That is why we have an impartial system.

213
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,270
Well, your system is broken.

214
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,740
You care about justice?

215
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,720
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

216
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
This city is rotting.

217
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,240
They talk about the Depression as if it's history, and it's not.

218
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
Things are worse than ever down here.

219
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,660
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs,

220
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,520
preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

221
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,160
You know, Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce.

222
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
He's destroying everything that they stood for.

223
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,700
You want to thank him for that? Here you go.

224
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,130
We all know where to find him.

225
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,890
But as long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one will touch him.

226
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,770
Good people like your parents will stand against injustice.

227
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,810
They're gone.

228
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,430
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

229
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.

230
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,460
What do you mean?

231
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,990
All these years I wanted to kill him.

232
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,790
Now I can't.

233
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:53,140
I would be ashamed of you.

234
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:38,990
You look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

235
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,970
No gun. I'm insulted.

236
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,220
You could have just sent a thank you note.

237
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,540
I didn't come here to thank you.

238
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,330
I came here to show you that not everyone at Gotham's afraid of you.

239
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,820
Only those who know me, kid.

240
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,260
Look around you.

241
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,230
You'll see two consulmen, a union official, a couple off-duty cops, and a judge.

242
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,530
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation in blowing your head off right here and right now in front of them.

243
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,190
Now, that's power you can't buy.

244
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,410
That's the power of fear.

245
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,070
I'm not afraid of you.

246
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,190
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

247
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,490
But you haven't thought it through.

248
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,150
You haven't thought about your lady friend down in the DA's office.

249
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,290
You haven't thought about your old butler.

250
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,030
Bang!

251
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,200
People from your world have so much to lose.

252
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,240
Now you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot,

253
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,500
you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

254
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,360
You've never tasted desperate.

255
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,940
You're Bruce Wayne, the Prince of Gotham.

256
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,640
you'd have to go a thousand miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

257
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,280
So don't come down here with your anger,

258
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
trying to prove something to yourself.

259
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,480
This is a world you'll never understand,

260
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,330
and you always fear what you don't understand.

261
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
Yeah, you got spirit, kid, I'll give you that.

262
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,060
More than your old man, anyway.

263
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,760
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

264
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,120
He said your father begged for mercy.

265
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,520
Like a dog.

266
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,340
Should have did better.

267
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,390
What?

268
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,390
Your jacket.

269
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,800
Okay.

270
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,690
Hey, hey, hey.

271
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,170
Let me have some nice coke.

272
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,950
If he carefully sees you with that,

273
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,490
they're gonna come looking for me.

274
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:04,970
Who?

275
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,030
Everyone.

276
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:35,400
Among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

277
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,460
First time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

278
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,040
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

279
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:54,840
And when I traveled, I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success.

280
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,940
But I never became one of them.

281
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,220
Fool, what the hell do I care what your name is? You're a criminal.

282
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

283
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,690
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind, conquer your fears.

284
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,620
A criminal is not complicated.

285
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,430
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

286
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,660
You fear your own power.

287
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,580
You fear your anger.

288
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,040
The drive to do great or terrible things.

289
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,050
Now, knee inwards.

290
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:45,390
Breathe.

291
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,880
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

292
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,740
You must bask in the fear of other men.

293
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,870
And men fear most what they cannot see.

294
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,140
You have to become a terrible thought.

295
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:53,710
You have to become an idea!

296
00:33:53,930 --> 00:36:06,810
I'm ready to lead these men.

297
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,430
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to...

298
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,160
Ivoid!

299
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,720
...not to fight criminals, this man is a murderer.

300
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,360
Smell it.

301
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,110
By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats?

302
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,950
Criminals mock society's laws.

303
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,950
You know those better than most.

304
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:06,350
I'm prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

305
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,040
Where would I be leading these men?

306
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:17,450
To strike at the heart of criminality.

307
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,340
Gotham's time has come.

308
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,060
Like Constantinople or Rome before it,

309
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,220
The city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

310
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,340
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

311
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,960
This is the most important function of the League.

312
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,260
It is one we performed for centuries.

313
00:37:41,660 --> 00:41:07,010
I will tell him you said he's alive.

314
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,640
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

315
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,580
Yes, I have.

316
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,450
You look very fashionable, apart from the mud.

317
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,270
Will you cut me back to Gotham for long, sir?

318
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,100
As long as it takes.

319
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,020
I'm gonna show the people of Gotham their city doesn't belong to the criminals.

320
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,350
In the Depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises, combating poverty.

321
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,270
He believed that his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

322
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,030
Did it?

323
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:56,870
In a way.

324
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,600
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

325
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,690
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy, and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

326
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,660
As a man, I'm flesh and blood.

327
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,160
I can be ignored, I can be destroyed, but as a symbol...

328
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,270
As a symbol, I can be everlasting.

329
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,890
What symbol?

330
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,170
Something.

331
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,520
I assume that as you're taking on the underworld,

332
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,460
this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals.

333
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,940
You're thinking about Rachel?

334
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,380
Rachel, you tell her. I was thinking of myself.

335
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,470
Told anyone I'm coming back?

336
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,910
I just couldn't figure.

337
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,010
The legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

338
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,590
Dead?

339
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,230
You've been gone seven years.

340
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,530
You have me declared dead?

341
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,290
Well, actually, it was Mr. Earl.

342
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,550
He's taken the company public.

343
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,970
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

344
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,630
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

345
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,100
Well, that's a good thing I left everything to you, then.

346
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,840
Quite so, sir.

347
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,430
And you can borrow the rolls if you like.

348
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,070
Just bring it back with a full tank.

349
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:21,070
In my opinion, Mr. Zazz is as much a danger to himself as to others.

350
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:25,010
And prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

351
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,230
Dr. Crane?

352
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:30,990
Oh, Miss Dawes.

353
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,490
You really think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

354
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,330
Well, I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I, Miss Dawes?

355
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:42,190
This is the third of Carmine Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane and moved into your asylum.

356
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,970
Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

357
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,550
Or the corrupt.

358
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:59,330
Mr. Finch, I think you should check with Miss Dawes here just what implications your office has authorized her to make.

359
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,610
If any.

360
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,980
What are you doing, Rachel?

361
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,120
What are you doing, Rachel?

362
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,220
What are you doing, Carl?

363
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,620
Looking out for you.

364
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,310
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.

365
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,570
How can you say that?

366
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,870
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you.

367
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,130
That's sweet.

368
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,130
Bless you, Pat, again, sir.

369
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,130
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

370
00:44:59,890 --> 00:47:05,470
Don't you mind, Doc. I'm bringing in the shipments.

371
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,210
We are paying you for that.

372
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,110
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as Phelous.

373
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:16,780
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

374
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,280
But you know who I'm working for.

375
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,920
And when he gets here...

376
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,560
He's coming to Gotham?

377
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,560
Yes, he is.

378
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,440
And when he gets here, he's not going to want to hear that you have endangered our operation

379
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,900
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

380
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,130
Who's bothering you?

381
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,090
There's a girl at the DA's office.

382
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:37,930
A Bayeroth.

383
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:38,750
Not this one.

384
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,950
Idealist, huh?

385
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,590
Well, there's an answer to that, too.

386
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,370
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

387
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,780
I don't think that Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy arms manufacture

388
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,090
as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

389
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,030
It's 20 years ago.

390
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,070
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about

391
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,550
what Thomas Wayne would have done.

392
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,490
Good morning, Mr. Earl's office.

393
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,130
Oh, yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

394
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,230
Good morning.

395
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,630
I'm here to see you, Mr. Earl.

396
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:21,610
Name?

397
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:23,770
Bruce Wayne.

398
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,770
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public,

399
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:34,090
But that is what we as responsible managers are going to do.

400
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,620
Jessica.

401
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,360
Jessica, where are you?

402
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,290
I want to answer your phone.

403
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,750
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earl. I'm sure they'll call back.

404
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,310
Bruce, you're supposed to be dead.

405
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:52,630
It's hard to disappoint.

406
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,910
I need you to take a look at this.

407
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,550
Have you seen him yet?

408
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,110
Who?

409
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,570
Wayne. He's been over the news. He's back.

410
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,730
I'm sure you realize I can't stop.

411
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,840
Big machine, too many wheels turning.

412
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,720
We're going public.

413
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,620
I understand.

414
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,000
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

415
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,940
I'm not looking to interfere.

416
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,880
I am looking for a job.

417
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,540
Oh?

418
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,520
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.

419
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,800
Any ideas where you would start?

420
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,720
Applied sciences caught my eye.

421
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,100
Fox department.

422
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,170
I'll let him know you're coming.

423
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,920
You look like him.

424
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,680
Yeah, you're dead.

425
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,860
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

426
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,700
This is where you belong.

427
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,130
Welcome home.

428
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,230
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.

429
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,500
All prototypes.

430
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,680
Not in production. On any level whatsoever.

431
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:53,880
None.

432
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,760
What did they tell you this place was?

433
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,320
They didn't tell me anything.

434
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,500
Earl told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.

435
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,350
Dead End.

436
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,690
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

437
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:14,100
You were on the board?

438
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,800
When your father ran things.

439
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,620
You knew my father?

440
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,520
Oh yeah.

441
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,220
Helped him build his train.

442
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,860
Ah, here we are.

443
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,920
Kevlar utility harness, gas-powered magnetic grapple gun, the 350-pound test monofilament.

444
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,830
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

445
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,010
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.

446
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,730
It's kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

447
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,830
Of course, Earl had to build a rock. Here we are.

448
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,710
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.

449
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,770
Kevlar bi-weave. Reinforced joints.

450
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:56,830
Terror-resistant.

451
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,230
This sucker will stop a knife.

452
00:50:58,770 --> 00:50:59,210
Bulletproof.

453
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,630
Anything but a straight shot.

454
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,410
Why didn't they put it into production?

455
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,930
Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

456
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,910
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

457
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,670
I want to borrow it.

458
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:21,770
for spelunking spelunking yeah you know cave diving expecting to run into much

459
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:29,180
gunfire in these caves but I'd rather mr. Earl didn't know about me bar Mr.

460
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:34,590
Wayne way I see it all this stuff is yours anyway

461
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:54,020
try charming at least you'll have company this must be the lowest

462
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:11,690
foundation of the southeast wing in the civil war your great great grandfather was involved

463
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:18,370
in the underground railroad secretly transporting free slaves to the north and i suspect these

464
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:38,020
cabins came in handy i can see everything all right from down here so thank you very much

465
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:04,490
part of this car from singapore fire dummy corporation indeed and then quite separately

466
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,690
We place an order to a Chinese company for these.

467
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,370
Put it together ourselves.

468
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:12,770
Precisely.

469
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,330
They'll have to be large orders to avoid suspicion.

470
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:18,230
How large?

471
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,470
Say, 10,000.

472
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,190
Well, at least we'll have spares.

473
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,030
Yes.

474
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,980
Don't suppose you want a taste.

475
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,730
Just keep offering.

476
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,830
Think maybe someday you'll get wise.

477
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:50,390
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flash.

478
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,430
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste.

479
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:53,950
Makes us guys nervous.

480
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:54,930
I'm no rat.

481
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,190
In a town that's been, who's that a rat to anyway?

482
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,090
Don't turn around.

483
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,870
Carmine Falcone brings a shimlets of drugs every week.

484
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:44,870
Nobody takes him down. Why?

485
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,250
He's paid up with the right people.

486
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,550
What will it take to bring him down?

487
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,900
Leverage on Judge Faden.

488
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,650
And a DA right enough to prosecute.

489
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,850
Rachel Dawes.

490
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,390
Who are you?

491
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,230
Watch for my side.

492
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,290
You're just one man.

493
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:49,430
What the hell was that?

494
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,310
Just some nut.

495
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,130
Well, what is it today?

496
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,550
Morse belonging?

497
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:01,330
No.

498
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,490
Today it's space jumping.

499
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:04,770
Space jumping?

500
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,390
Is that like parachuting?

501
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,070
Kind of.

502
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,960
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

503
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,420
You know, I think I have just the thing.

504
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,080
It's called memory cloth.

505
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,160
Notice anything?

506
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,500
Regularly flexible, but put a current through it,

507
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,940
molecules realign, become rigid.

508
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,540
What kind of shapes can you make?

509
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,580
Can be tailored to fit in any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

510
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,980
Too expensive for the Army?

511
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,100
Right, I don't think they ever tried to market it

512
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,660
to the billionaires belonging to base dumping ground.

513
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,900
Look, Mr. Fox.

514
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:43,600
Yes, sir?

515
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,960
If you're uncomfortable...

516
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,560
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing

517
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,440
when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

518
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,890
but don't think of me as an idiot.

519
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:01,840
What's that?

520
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:05,920
More of a tumbler?

521
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:17,470
It was built as a bridging vehicle.

522
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,250
During combat,

523
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,830
two of these would jump over a river

524
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,710
towing cables.

525
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,880
And over here on the throttle,

526
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,180
flip that open and throttle up,

527
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,090
this will boost you into a rampage jump.

528
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:32,900
Shut down!

529
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,130
Shut down!

530
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:42,070
Disengaged.

531
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:47,650
We never could get the damn bridge to work, but this baby works just fine.

532
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:58,190
So what do you think?

533
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,990
Does it come in black?

534
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,370
I need you at the docks Thursday.

535
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:05,890
Problems?

536
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,270
I don't want any trouble with the last shipment.

537
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:08,830
Sure.

538
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,730
We're on the street. You got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

539
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,270
That's not right.

540
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,970
And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

541
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,970
So what's your point, Mr. Flass?

542
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,590
Have you seen the girl?

543
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,010
It's a cute little sister, dear.

544
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,270
I think it's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe.

545
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,030
Even for this town.

546
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:34,090
Never underestimate Gotham City.

547
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,990
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

548
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,950
Sometimes, sometimes things just go bad.

549
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,800
Sir, problem with the graphite, sir.

550
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,130
The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.

551
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,730
At least they gave us a discount.

552
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,040
Quite.

553
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:56,200
In the meantime sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head.

554
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,910
Why bats, lost the way?

555
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,470
Bats frighten me.

556
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,590
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

557
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:08,570
What is this?

558
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:13,770
Continue.

559
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:21,730
Looks fine out there.

560
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,500
Bears, they give straight to the dealers.

561
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,420
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the narrows.

562
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,320
What's the difference?

563
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,280
Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

564
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,980
Don't burden yourself with these secrets of scary people

565
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:50,330
Hey

566
01:00:51,950 --> 01:05:05,450
Stikes, I wouldn't be too sure of that

567
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:03,340
Gangs guardian angels are the goddamn Salvation Army get them off the street and off the front page

568
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,980
They say it was just one guy or a creature

569
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:14,120
Or some asshole in the costume this guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime wards

570
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,320
No one takes the bar into their own hands in my city

571
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:18,470
Understand?

572
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,630
There's no way to bury it now.

573
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,150
Maybe so, but there's still Judge Faden.

574
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,050
We've got Faden covered.

575
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:25,570
Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

576
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:28,810
Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat,

577
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,310
we've got Balcony at the scene.

578
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,570
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.

579
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,110
This bat character gave us everything.

580
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,290
Okay, let's do it.

581
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,030
Bats are nocturnal.

582
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,710
Bats may be, but even for billionaire playboys,

583
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,450
three o'clock is pushing it.

584
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,450
The price for leading a double life, I fear.

585
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,140
Your theatrics made an impression.

586
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,060
Metricality, deception.

587
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,360
They're powerful weapons, Alfred.

588
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,520
This is a good start.

589
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,910
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come,

590
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,460
it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

591
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,280
Polo, for instance.

592
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,980
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

593
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,520
Strange injuries, a non-existent social life.

594
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,830
These things beg the question

595
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,480
as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do

596
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,820
with his time and his money.

597
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,600
What does someone like me do?

598
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:29,320
Drive sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale.

599
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:35,610
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun, you might even have a little buy accident.

600
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,050
Sir, we have a situation.

601
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:42,350
Alright.

602
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,590
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.

603
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:50,860
It's heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.

604
01:07:50,860 --> 01:08:00,470
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter. It's designed for desert warfare.

605
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:01,350
But it...

606
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:09,950
It looks like somebody turned it on.

607
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:19,390
It uses focus microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

608
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:32,090
The damage to the ship was catastrophic. The weapon itself is...

609
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:35,189
Missing?

610
01:08:35,189 --> 01:09:01,160
missing yeah he's done something the police have never done you can't take

611
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:06,359
the law into your own hands at least he's getting something done Bruce help

612
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:14,760
me out here well I dresses up like a bat clearly has issues but he's put Falcone

613
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,340
behind bars and now the cops want to bring him in so what does that tell you

614
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,080
They're jealous.

615
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,300
Sir, the pool is for decoration,

616
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,000
and your friends do not have swimwear.

617
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,330
Well, they're European.

618
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,729
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

619
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,870
It is not a question of money.

620
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:40,290
You see, I'm buying this hotel

621
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:45,850
and setting some new rules about the pool area.

622
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:50,410
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

623
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,750
And a straight jacket to pin it on.

624
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:02,970
Bruce?

625
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,080
Rachel?

626
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,720
I'd heard you were back.

627
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:13,750
What are you doing?

628
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,990
Uh, just swimming.

629
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,650
Wow, it is good to see you.

630
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,030
You've gone a long time.

631
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,850
I know. How are things?

632
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,840
Same. Job's getting worse.

633
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,820
Can't change the world on your own.

634
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,580
What choice do I have?

635
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,570
When you're too busy swimming.

636
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,610
Rachel, all of... all this...

637
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,570
It's not me.

638
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:49,080
It's... inside. I am...

639
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:06,370
Bruce, deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

640
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,250
But it's not who you are underneath.

641
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,550
It's what you do that defines you.

642
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,990
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

643
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,790
Not at all. He cut his wrists.

644
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,810
Probably looking for the insanity plea.

645
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,810
But if anything should happen...

646
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,730
Of course. Better safe than sorry.

647
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,480
Yeah, Dr. Crane.

648
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,640
I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

649
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,120
The walls are closing in.

650
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,140
Blah, blah, blah.

651
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,540
A couple of days of this food will be true.

652
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,060
What do you want?

653
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,740
I want to know how you're going to convince me to keep my mouth shut.

654
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,520
About what?

655
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:57,900
You don't know anything.

656
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,800
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

657
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,940
and I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nuthouse.

658
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,140
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

659
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,960
And those goons you used, I own the muscle in this town.

660
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,520
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months,

661
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,080
so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want it.

662
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:30,500
Well, I already know what he'll say, that we should kill you.

663
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,910
Even he can't get me in here.

664
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,510
Not in my town.

665
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,050
Would you like to see my mask?

666
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,130
I use it in my experiments.

667
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:53,140
It's probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

668
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,140
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

669
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,350
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

670
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,490
They scream and they cry.

671
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,070
Which is your game now?

672
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:10,710
He's not faking. Not that one.

673
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,240
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham.

674
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,580
I can't treat him here.

675
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,350
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

676
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:49,610
It's a start.

677
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,850
Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

678
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:55,150
Oh, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

679
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,120
They were splitting the shipment in two.

680
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,670
Only half went to the dealers.

681
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,330
Why? What about the other half?

682
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,610
Vlas knows.

683
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,670
He won't talk.

684
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:05,930
He'll talk to me.

685
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,650
Mission Alive set up a massive task force to catch you.

686
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:11,370
He thinks you're dangerous.

687
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,710
What do you think?

688
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:23,070
I think you're trying to help, but I've been wrong before.

689
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,110
I have kids to feed.

690
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,570
Well, I don't like falafel.

691
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,630
Where were the other drugs going?

692
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:58,750
I never knew.

693
01:14:59,230 --> 01:14:59,790
I don't know.

694
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,330
I swear to God.

695
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,010
Swear to me!

696
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:09,350
I don't know.

697
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:10,390
I never knew.

698
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:11,150
Never.

699
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:14,870
They went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealer.

700
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,170
Why?

701
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,840
There was something.

702
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,060
Something else in the drugs.

703
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,520
Something hidden.

704
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,240
What?

705
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,000
I never went to the drop-off point.

706
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,720
It was in the narrows.

707
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,860
Cops only go there when they're in force.

708
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,320
Do I look like a cop?

709
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,420
BABYLON!

710
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:46,050
What am I talking about?

711
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:48,210
What's your problem with it?

712
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:48,930
It shouldn't exist.

713
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:53,230
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

714
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,770
So I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

715
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,780
Listen, Counselor.

716
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,990
We don't want to know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

717
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,090
Things are working a little differently now.

718
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,230
Open it up.

719
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,850
It's you, isn't it?

720
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,850
Everybody's been talking about you.

721
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,070
Don't get in here!

722
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,260
The other kids won't believe me.

723
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:28,950
Bit of all traces.

724
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:31,570
They'll torch the whole place.

725
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:32,290
All right.

726
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,950
It's your birthday.

727
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,110
This was so much more potent.

728
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:16,790
Hallucinogen.

729
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,450
Weaponized in aerosol form.

730
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,310
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

731
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,830
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

732
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:30,610
I analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds in the protein-based catalyst.

733
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,990
That meant I understand any of that.

734
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:36,690
Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

735
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,530
Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.

736
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,490
Could you make more?

737
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,010
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

738
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:47,070
You know how it is, Mr. Fox. You're out at night looking for kicks.

739
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,690
Someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens.

740
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,090
I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.

741
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,210
Alfred, always a pleasure.

742
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:03,580
Lucius, you sure you don't want to come in?

743
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,390
I have to get back. I just wanted to leave this.

744
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:06,860
Thank you.

745
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:07,340
Rachel?

746
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:12,350
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

747
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,410
Must have been quite an occasion.

748
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,670
It is my birthday.

749
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,350
I know.

750
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,390
I'm sorry I can't come tonight.

751
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,710
I was just dropping off your present.

752
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:20,590
You've got better plans?

753
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:25,530
My boss has been missing for two days, which in this town means that I should probably

754
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,290
start by looking at the bottom of the river.

755
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:27,730
Rachel.

756
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,550
Rachel Doss.

757
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:34,700
Who authorized that?

758
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,110
Get Crane down there right now.

759
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,490
Do not take no for an answer.

760
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:40,930
Call Dr. Lehman and tell him we'll need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.

761
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,150
What's wrong?

762
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,230
It's Falcone.

763
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,210
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

764
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,350
You're going to Arkham now?

765
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:48,990
It's in the narrows, Rachel.

766
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,700
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

767
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,800
Some of us have work to do.

768
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,020
You be careful.

769
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,200
With Master waiting, the guests will be arriving.

770
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,580
Keep them happy until I arrive.

771
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,300
Tell them that joke you know.

772
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,110
What's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

773
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:11,750
I need some information.

774
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,590
The Wayne and the...

775
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:16,590
47B-1ME.

776
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
It's a microwave emitter.

777
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,580
It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

778
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:28,330
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air,

779
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,000
but isn't that illegal?

780
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:36,230
I want all the information on the development of this project.

781
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:40,290
All data, files, backup disks on my desk right away.

782
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:41,690
Did you lose one?

783
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,700
I'm merging your department with Archives.

784
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:20,660
This is most irregular. I have nothing further to add to the report I filed with the judge.

785
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,290
I have questions about your report.

786
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:23,210
Such as?

787
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,760
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness

788
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,250
to suddenly have a complete psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

789
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:35,670
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

790
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,900
What's Scarecrow?

791
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,760
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia on an external tormentor,

792
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,800
usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.

793
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,900
In this case, a scarecrow.

794
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,520
He's drugged?

795
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,980
Psychopharmacology is my primary.

796
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:01,260
I'm a strong advocate.

797
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,630
Outside, he was a giant.

798
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,550
In here, only the mind can grant you power.

799
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,530
You enjoy the reversal.

800
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,350
I respect the mind's power over the body.

801
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,680
It's why I do what I do.

802
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:18,020
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

803
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:23,920
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone, including blood work.

804
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:31,280
Find out what exactly you put him on first thing tomorrow then tonight. I've already paged dr. Laman at County General

805
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:34,530
as you wish

806
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,050
This way, please

807
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:44,630
There's something I think you should see

808
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:07,600
This is where we make the medicine. Perhaps you should have something

809
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:09,910
clear your head

810
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:56,950
What do we do what anyone dollar comes around?

811
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:04,220
You want the cops here at this point. They can't stop us

812
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,290
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

813
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:11,390
Force him outside, the police will take him down.

814
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:12,930
What about her?

815
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,390
She hasn't got long.

816
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:16,170
I gave her a concentrated dose.

817
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,410
The mind can only take so much.

818
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,430
Now, go.

819
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,340
The things they say about him.

820
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,340
Can you wait, he fly?

821
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,120
I heard he can disappear.

822
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,540
Well, we'll find out.

823
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,160
Won't we?

824
01:27:32,940 --> 01:28:54,140
He isn't here right now.

825
01:28:54,300 --> 01:29:30,870
Don't go in now. I'll be right behind you sir

826
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,620
What's on the way?

827
01:29:36,450 --> 01:30:32,310
Do you see dogs? Let me get it down to the medics. They can't help her but I can

828
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,380
Talks in hidden inside Falcone's drugs and then dumping it in the water supply

829
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:58,350
What was he planning? I don't know. We'll see working for Falcone. He meant to someone else someone worse

830
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:03,410
I need to get her the antidote before the damage becomes permanent. How long does she have no long?

831
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,030
What is that?

832
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:43,860
We gotta go I'll get my car

833
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:47,900
Yours I

834
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:59,570
Gotta get me one of those

835
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,530
It's a black

836
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:07,520
Tank

837
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,620
Stay calm

838
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:13,750
with poison

839
01:37:56,690 --> 01:38:00,060
Notify the water company there's got to be a way of isolating the areas you understand

840
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,560
They put it all in. They must have been at this for weeks.

841
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,560
Got thems entire water supplies laced with it.

842
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,320
Why haven't we felt the effects?

843
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,360
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed to the lungs.

844
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:19,790
How do you feel?

845
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,630
Why did you bring me here?

846
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:28,790
If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

847
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:30,150
You were poisoned.

848
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,630
It's Dr. Crane.

849
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,470
Rest. Gordon has Crane.

850
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,960
Sergeant Gordon, your friend.

851
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:39,920
I don't have the luxury of friends.

852
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:42,110
I'm gonna give you a sedative.

853
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,340
You'll wake up back at home.

854
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,600
When you do, get these to Gordon.

855
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,340
And Gordon alone trusts no one.

856
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,320
What are they?

857
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,260
The antidote.

858
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,440
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

859
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,060
Mass production?

860
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,880
Cream was just a pawn.

861
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,720
We need to be ready.

862
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,560
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham,

863
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,240
the only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats

864
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,820
was when you said that it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

865
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:34,580
It's not.

866
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:36,360
What would you call that?

867
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:39,890
Damn good television.

868
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:41,750
It's a miracle no one was killed.

869
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,710
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

870
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:48,030
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

871
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:53,380
I'm using this monster to help other people just like my father did.

872
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:58,130
For Thomas Wayne, helping others wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.

873
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:00,270
It's Rachel, Alfred.

874
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:01,970
She was dying.

875
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:04,020
She's downstairs sedated.

876
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,190
I need you to take her home.

877
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,010
Well, we both care for Rachel, sir.

878
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:09,210
But what you're doing has to be beyond that.

879
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:12,090
It can't be personal, or you're just vigilante.

880
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:13,290
Is Fox still here?

881
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:14,170
Yes, sir.

882
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,010
We need to send these people away now.

883
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,250
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests out there, sir.

884
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,590
You have a name to maintain.

885
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,270
I don't care about my name.

886
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,670
It's not just your name, sir.

887
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,710
It's your father's name.

888
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,620
And it's all that's left of him.

889
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:31,530
Don't destroy it.

890
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,960
Happy birthday, Bruce.

891
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:50,320
Thank you.

892
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:53,570
How'd the stock offering go?

893
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:54,970
Prices soared.

894
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:55,990
Who was buying?

895
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:58,490
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

896
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:29,600
it's a bit technical. The key thing is our company's future is secure. What was

897
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:37,770
the plan, Crane? How were you gonna get your toxin into the air? Who were you

898
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:38,840
working for, Crane?

899
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:56,910
Thank you. And thank you for that item.

900
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:02,110
You're welcome. I know you put it to good use.

901
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:06,750
I already have. How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

902
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:12,090
weeks why somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water

903
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:20,220
supply what supply won't help with this person inhaler unless you have a

904
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:24,030
microwave emitter powerful enough to vaporize all the water in the mains a

905
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:30,070
microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprise is just misplaced misplaced

906
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:36,840
we're all just fired for asking too many questions about it I need you to go back

907
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,150
to Wayne Enterprises right now and start making more of that antidote I think the

908
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:43,730
police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on okay my security

909
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:48,350
clearance has been revoked stop a man like you now would it that's both now

910
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:58,760
Bruce there's somebody here you must meet now am I pronouncing this right

911
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:14,110
mr. Raz al Ghul not a Raza ghoul watched him die but his Raza ghoul immortal

912
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:19,730
are his methods supernatural.

913
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:28,870
More cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ross.

914
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,020
Surely a man who spends his nights

915
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:35,630
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham

916
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:37,500
wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

917
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,080
I warned you about compassion.

918
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:47,650
But the quarrel is with me.

919
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:50,730
You let these people go.

920
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,860
Welcome to explain the situation to them.

921
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:58,180
Everyone?

922
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:00,540
Everybody?

923
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:09,980
I, uh, want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

924
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:22,230
There's a thing about being a Wayne that you're never short of a few freeloaders like yourselves

925
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:25,930
to fill up your mansion with, so here's to you people.

926
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,530
Thank you.

927
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:28,890
That's enough.

928
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:29,090
I'm not finished.

929
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:38,570
To all of you, uh, all you phonies, all of you two-faced friends, you sycophantic suck-ups

930
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:40,990
who smiled through your teeth at me,

931
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:43,990
please leave me in peace.

932
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,510
Please go.

933
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:50,130
Stop smiling. It's not a joke.

934
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:53,270
Please leave. The party's over. Get out.

935
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:57,190
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

936
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:13,330
Amusing, but pointless.

937
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:16,030
None of these people have longed to live.

938
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:18,900
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

939
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,580
So Crane was working for you.

940
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,060
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

941
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,780
He was able to weaponize it.

942
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:30,410
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

943
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:34,270
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

944
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:39,890
For real, you are going to release Crane's poison on the entire city?

945
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:44,550
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

946
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:59,330
You're going to destroy millions of lives.

947
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:02,870
Only a cynical man would call what these people have lives, Wayne.

948
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:07,130
Crime, despair. This is not how man was supposed to live.

949
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:12,310
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.

950
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:18,010
We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground.

951
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:23,310
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence, we return to restore the balance.

952
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:29,190
Gotham isn't beyond saving. Give me more time. There are good people here.

953
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:34,070
You were defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

954
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,840
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.

955
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:54,970
But I believed in you.

956
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:59,110
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.

957
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,510
You are my greatest student.

958
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,580
It should be you who is standing by my side, saving the world.

959
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:08,050
I'll be standing where I belong.

960
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:12,530
And the people of Gotham.

961
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:16,350
No one can save Gotham.

962
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:24,210
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

963
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:30,260
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

964
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:34,520
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

965
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,560
You attacked Gotham before?

966
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,340
Of course.

967
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,200
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

968
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,660
With Gotham we tried a new one, economics.

969
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,310
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens, such as your parents.

970
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,000
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

971
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:04,170
enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal. Their deaths galvanized the city into saving

972
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:10,450
itself and Gotham has limped on ever since. We are back to finish the job. At this time,

973
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:15,480
no misguided idealists will get in the way. Like your father, you lack the courage to do

974
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:21,450
all that is necessary. If someone stands in the way of true justice, you simply walk up behind

975
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:32,510
them and stab them in the heart. You never did learn to mind your surroundings.

976
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,190
Justice is balance.

977
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:40,090
You burned my house and left me for dead.

978
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:44,070
Considerous, even.

979
01:48:44,730 --> 01:49:03,130
No one comes out. Make sure.

980
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:16,150
How many from maximum security?

981
01:49:16,690 --> 01:49:17,490
Every one of them.

982
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,590
Serial killers, rapists.

983
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:20,790
Get them to raise the bridges.

984
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:22,610
We don't want any getting off the island.

985
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:23,910
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges.

986
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:26,540
But I get every available unit out here

987
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,890
to catch the homicidal maniacs

988
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:30,150
that are running loose out there.

989
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:30,730
Come on.

990
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,100
I hope you're not a member of the Fire Brigade.

991
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:05,190
He's lost the way.

992
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:13,530
What is the point of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody load?

993
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,190
Or maybe you'd like to see some excessive force.

994
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,110
Hey, hey, hey!

995
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:37,610
Bad man with the gun.

996
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:44,370
With residents curious at the unprecedented show of police strength around a B&A,

997
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:44,910
the situation is...

998
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,990
Oh, lady, we're about to raise these bridges.

999
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:49,230
Sir, I'm a Gotham City District Attorney. Let me pass.

1000
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,940
Somebody here to see you.

1001
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:05,600
What are you doing here?

1002
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,040
A mutual friend sent me this.

1003
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:12,170
counteracts green's toxin hopefully you won't need it unless he's got some way of getting that

1004
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:23,750
crap into the air all right last one across i better get you off the island before they

1005
01:52:23,750 --> 01:53:13,090
raise the bridges patrolman stop i can't find my mom gentlemen time to spread the word

1006
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:50,690
and the word is spiking right there now water main is right under the narrows

1007
01:53:50,890 --> 01:55:45,310
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1008
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:46,350
This is just the beginning.

1009
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:51,070
If they hit the whole city with toxin, there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart from mass panic.

1010
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:52,070
How are they gonna do that?

1011
01:55:52,130 --> 01:55:53,070
They'll be using the train.

1012
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:57,070
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1013
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:02,430
If they get their machine into Wayne Station, it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the entire city's water supply.

1014
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:04,590
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1015
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:07,470
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.

1016
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:08,530
What do you need?

1017
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:09,550
Can you drive stick?

1018
01:56:09,550 --> 01:57:15,040
drive stick. Nothing to fear but fear itself. I'm here to help. Save us. Don't peek. This is Gordon.

1019
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:42,660
Prepare to lower the bridge. You could die. At least tell me your name. It's not who I am

1020
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:48,020
underneath, but what I do that defines me.

1021
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,080
Bruce?

1022
01:57:51,740 --> 01:58:27,270
You took my advice about theatricality a bit?

1023
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:27,850
Literally.

1024
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:29,010
It ends here.

1025
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,530
For you and the police, maybe.

1026
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:32,970
My fate, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1027
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:35,730
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.

1028
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:38,430
I can't beat two of your pawns.

1029
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:39,450
As you wish.

1030
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:54,610
GPS online.

1031
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,460
See 100 yards.

1032
01:59:03,760 --> 02:05:12,520
I seem to remember firing you.

1033
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,720
You did. I got another job. Yours.

1034
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:20,840
Whose authority?

1035
02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:26,430
Batman may have made the front page, but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

1036
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:34,800
Bruce Wayne?

1037
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,800
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1038
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:40,420
Well, the fact that I'm the owner.

1039
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,520
What are you talking about?

1040
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,810
The company went public a week ago.

1041
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:45,680
And I bought most of the shares.

1042
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:49,140
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1043
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:55,000
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing is that my company's future.

1044
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:57,710
Right, Mr. Fox?

1045
02:05:58,330 --> 02:05:59,410
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1046
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:03,470
Didn't you get the memo?

1047
02:06:04,130 --> 02:06:24,680
I didn't tell you, Rachel.

1048
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:27,010
No, no, Bruce. I'm sorry.

1049
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:34,410
The day that Chell died, I... I said terrible things.

1050
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:36,010
But true things.

1051
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,180
I was a coward with a gun.

1052
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:43,260
Justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.

1053
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:46,330
I never stopped thinking about you.

1054
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:49,350
About us.

1055
02:06:50,050 --> 02:06:54,890
When I heard you were back, I started to hope.

1056
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,820
Then I found out about your mask.

1057
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:36,840
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1058
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:39,230
A man I loved.

1059
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,810
A man who vanished.

1060
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,950
He never came back at all.

1061
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:13,990
Proved me wrong, you know.

1062
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,870
About what?

1063
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:20,130
Father would be very proud of you.

1064
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,000
Just like me.

1065
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:50,630
What will you do?

1066
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:53,770
Rebuild it?

1067
02:08:55,670 --> 02:08:57,190
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1068
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:05,920
Just the way it was, sir?

1069
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:08,760
Yeah, why?

1070
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:13,760
I thought this might be a good opportunity for, uh, improving the foundations.

1071
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,360
In the southeast corner?

1072
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:18,120
Precisely, sir.

1073
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:36,580
I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1074
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:38,450
Well, Sergeant?

1075
02:09:38,910 --> 02:09:41,790
Oh, it's Lieutenant now. He really started something.

1076
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:45,650
Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets.

1077
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,510
But?

1078
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:48,710
The Narrows is lost.

1079
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:53,810
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1080
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:57,610
We will. We can recover.

1081
02:09:58,570 --> 02:09:59,550
What about Escalation?

1082
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:00,550
Escalation?

1083
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:04,710
When we start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics.

1084
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:09,690
When we start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1085
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:10,630
And?

1086
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:15,560
And you're wearing a mask, jumping off rooftops.

1087
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:18,020
I take this guy.

1088
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:21,000
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1089
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:24,780
Had a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1090
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,280
Leaves a calling card.

1091
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:39,550
I never said thank you.
