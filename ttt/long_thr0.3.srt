1
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,880
Does it matter? We'll never turn to it anyway.

2
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,460
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

3
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,100
What the hell is that?

4
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,400
Cut him down.

5
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,220
Unacceptable.

6
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,880
I don't care if it's rival gangs, guardian angels, or the goddamn Salvation Army.

7
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,360
Get him off the street and off the front page.

8
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,980
They say it was just one guy. Or a creature.

9
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,820
Or some asshole in a costume.

10
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:09,940
Yeah.

11
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,100
This guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime lords.

12
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,340
No one takes the bar into their own hands in my city.

13
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:18,620
Understand?

14
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,540
No way to bury it now.

15
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,160
Maybe so, but there's still Judge Faden.

16
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,040
We've got Faden covered.

17
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,600
Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

18
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,820
Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat,

19
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,320
we've got Falcone at the scene.

20
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,120
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

21
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,320
Okay, let's do it.

22
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,120
Bats are not carnal.

23
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,440
Bats may be, but even for billionaire playboys, three o'clock is pushing it.

24
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,420
Price for leading a double life, I fear.

25
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,140
Your theatrics made an impression.

26
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,080
Theatricality, deception.

27
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,540
You have powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

28
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,980
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come,

29
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,460
it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

30
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,419
Polo, for instance.

31
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,020
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

32
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,540
Strange injuries, a non-existent social life.

33
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,840
These things beg the question

34
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,820
as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

35
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,620
What does someone like me do?

36
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,860
Drive sports cars, date movie stars,

37
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,100
Movie stars?

38
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,320
Buy things that are not for sale?

39
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:30,940
Who knows, Master Wayne?

40
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,800
You start pretending to have fun,

41
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,600
you might even have a little buy accident.

42
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,120
Sir, we have a situation.

43
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:42,440
All right.

44
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,580
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.

45
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,280
Heavily damaged, all crew missing.

46
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,880
Probably dead.

47
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:56,500
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.

48
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,080
It's a microwave emitter.

49
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,450
It's designed for desert warfare.

50
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:04,540
It looks like somebody...

51
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,960
turned it on.

52
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,500
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

53
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,220
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

54
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,480
The weapon itself is, um...

55
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,400
Missing?

56
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:37,440
Yeah.

57
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,820
That's pretty good.

58
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,000
Nice car.

59
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,100
We should see another one.

60
01:08:51,680 --> 01:09:00,280
He's done something the police have never done.

61
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,650
You can't take the law into your own hands.

62
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,700
At least he's getting something done.

63
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,900
Bruce, help me out here.

64
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,720
Well, the guy dresses up like a bat.

65
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,160
Clearly has issues.

66
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

67
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,459
And now the cops want to bring him in.

68
01:09:17,459 --> 01:09:18,339
So what does that tell you?

69
01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:19,079
They're jealous.

70
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:25,120
Sir, the pool is for decoration and your friends do not have swimming rooms.

71
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,340
Well, they're European.

72
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,740
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

73
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,780
It is not a question of money.

74
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:45,820
You see, I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

75
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:50,420
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

76
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,720
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

77
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,080
Bruce?

78
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,100
Rachel?

79
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,740
I'd heard you were back.

80
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,740
What are you doing?

81
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,000
Uh, just swimming.

82
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,640
Wow. It is good to see you.

83
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,060
You haven't gone a long time.

84
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,860
I know. How are things?

85
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:24,680
Same.

86
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,840
Job's getting worse.

87
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,820
Can't change the world on your own.

88
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,580
What choice do I have?

89
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,560
When you're too busy swimming.

90
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,640
Rachel, all of...

91
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,600
all this...

92
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,580
It's not me.

93
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:45,980
It's...

94
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,080
Inside, I am...

95
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:51,980
I am more.

96
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,940
Come on, Bruce, come!

97
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,100
We have some more Italian leaves to buy!

98
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:00,960
Bruce...

99
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,360
Deep down, you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

100
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,260
But it's not who you are underneath.

101
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,540
It's what you do that defines you.

102
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:45,380
I'm sorry.

103
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,200
are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

104
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,440
In a couple of days of this food,

105
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,560
it'll be true.

106
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,330
What do you want? I want to know

107
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,420
how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth

108
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,330
shut. About what? You don't

109
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,300
know anything. I know you don't want

110
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,220
the cops to take a closer look at the drugs

111
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,240
they seized. I know

112
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,300
about your experiments with the inmates of

113
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,190
your nut house. See,

114
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,310
I don't go into business with a guy without finding out

115
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:10,140
his dirty secrets.

116
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,420
And those goons you used,

117
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,960
I own the muscle in this town.

118
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,500
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months.

119
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,760
So whatever he's planning, it's big.

120
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,080
And I want it.

121
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,800
Well, I already know what he'll say.

122
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,500
That we should kill you.

123
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,900
Even he can't get me in here.

124
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,460
Not in my town.

125
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,060
Would you like to see my mask?

126
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,140
I use it in my experiments.

127
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,140
I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

128
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,240
But these crazies, you can't stand it.

129
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,320
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

130
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
They scream and they cry.

131
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,060
Which is your game now?

132
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,720
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

133
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,240
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham.

134
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,580
I can't treat him here.

135
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,539
Storm's coming.

136
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,360
Scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone

137
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:49,590
It's a start

138
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,860
Your partner was at the docks with Falcone

139
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,120
Oh, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer

140
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,140
They were splitting the shipment in two

141
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,680
Only half went to the dealers

142
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,340
Why? What about the other half?

143
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,720
Flass knows

144
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,720
He won't talk

145
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:05,980
He'll talk to me

146
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,700
Mission to Love set up a massive task force to catch you

147
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,380
He thinks you're dangerous.

148
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,720
What do you think?

149
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,780
I think you're trying to help.

150
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,160
But I've been wrong before.

151
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,180
Come on, I ain't got a way.

152
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,100
I have kids to feed.

153
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,620
What, you don't like falafel?

154
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,600
Where were the other drugs going?

155
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,740
I never knew.

156
01:14:59,220 --> 01:14:59,740
I don't know.

157
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,320
I swear to God.

158
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,040
Swear to me.

159
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,240
I don't know.

160
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,080
I never knew. Never.

161
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,860
They went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealer.

162
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:15,280
Why?

163
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:17,840
There was something.

164
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,100
Something else in the drugs.

165
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,520
Something hidden.

166
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,060
What?

167
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,980
I never went to the drop-off point.

168
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,720
It was in the narrows.

169
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,860
Cops only go there when they're in force.

170
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,120
Do I look like a cop?

171
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,620
No!

172
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,020
This is the one I'm talking about.

173
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,240
What's your problem with it?

174
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:48,920
It shouldn't exist.

175
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,240
The ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

176
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,780
So I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

177
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,980
Listen, Counselor, we don't want to know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
