1
00:01:00,720 --> 00:02:28,500
my garden only before breakfast

2
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,950
how little man and i am

3
00:02:39,390 --> 00:03:36,530
the devil you're not the devil protection protection for them

4
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,860
are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them

5
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,710
on one at a time actually they were uh

6
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,260
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

7
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,470
How do you know my name?

8
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,870
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear, no matter how deeply chooses to sink.

9
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,290
Who are you?

10
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,649
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Raz Al Ghul, a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

11
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
A man who can offer you a path.

12
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,820
Makes you think I need a path.

13
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,150
Someone like you is only here by choice.

14
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:33,720
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity, but whatever your original intentions, you have become truly lost.

15
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,220
On what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

16
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,770
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice.

17
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,230
The League of Shadows.

18
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,700
The Vigilantes.

19
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,940
No, no, no.

20
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,320
The Vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

21
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,300
he can be destroyed or locked up.

22
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,370
But more than just a man,

23
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,650
if you devote yourself to an ideal,

24
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,030
and if they can't stop you,

25
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,610
then you become something else entirely.

26
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,760
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

27
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,330
Tomorrow you will be released.

28
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,670
If you are bored of brawling with petty thieves

29
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,010
and want to achieve something,

30
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,290
there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.

31
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,250
Pick one of these flowers.

32
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,850
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain,

33
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,510
You may find what you were looking for in the first place.

34
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,450
And...

35
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,050
...feelate the fears in others.

36
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,130
Ready to begin.

37
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,190
Stay.

38
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,080
Death does not wait for you to be raped.

39
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,620
Death is not considered warfare.

40
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,130
And make no mistake.

41
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,190
Here you face death.

42
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,910
You did so.

43
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,370
Ah!

44
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,670
I'll set the bone and...

45
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,350
...take him for an x-ray later.

46
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,550
Very good, sir.

47
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,430
I'm very sorry, sir.

48
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:34,810
I've talked.

49
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,570
Don't worry, that's fine.

50
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,170
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

51
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,670
And why did we fall, Bruce?

52
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,950
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

53
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,750
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

54
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,530
They were afraid of you.

55
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,930
Afraid of me?

56
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,470
All creatures feel fear.

57
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,190
Even the scary ones.

58
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,130
Especially the scary ones.

59
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,730
I got something to show you.

60
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,790
It's time to get up.

61
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,670
Maybe.

62
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,270
Did you build this train, Dad?

63
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,840
Gotham's been good to our family.

64
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,060
But the city's been suffering.

65
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,390
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

66
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,790
So we build a new, cheap public transportation system to unite the city.

67
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,650
And at the center, Wayne Tower.

68
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Is that where you work?

69
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,660
No, I work at the hospital.

70
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,780
I lead the running of our company to much better men.

71
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,640
Better?

72
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,540
Well, more interested men.

73
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,690
I just needed some fresh air.

74
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,450
A little bit of opera goes a long way.

75
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,550
Right, Bruce?

76
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,670
Come on.

77
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:31,930
Let's go.

78
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,390
Wallace.

79
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,110
Joy.

80
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,210
I'm a bastard.

81
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:40,870
That's fine.

82
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,370
I'm a bastard.

83
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,550
Take it easy.

84
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,610
Take it easy.

85
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Here you go.

86
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,250
That's fine.

87
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,300
Now just take it and go.

88
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,520
I said you were...

89
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:58,980
Hey!

90
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,860
I need you!

91
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,920
Shut up!

92
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,060
Says your fathers.

93
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
We'll be watching the Empire.

94
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,060
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

95
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,630
It was my fault, Alfred.

96
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,230
I made the deed to fear.

97
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,810
No, no, no, no, no.

98
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,070
If my handguns get...

99
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,290
It was nothing that you did.

100
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,320
it was him.

101
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,960
So what?

102
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:03,830
So you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

103
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,710
My anger outweighs my guilt.

104
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,430
Come.

105
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,440
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

106
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,380
I will teach you to confront it

107
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,760
and to face the truth.

108
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,240
You know how to fight six men.

109
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,240
We can teach you how to engage 600.

110
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,790
You know how to disappear.

111
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,910
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

112
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,130
Invisible.

113
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,080
Abhi!

114
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,670
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

115
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
Always mind your surroundings.

116
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,120
Ninjutsu employs explosive powders.

117
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,000
As weapons?

118
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,200
Or distractions?

119
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,380
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

120
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,520
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

121
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,830
Who is he?

122
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,770
Who is he?

123
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,290
He was a farmer, and he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

124
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,430
Now he is a prisoner.

125
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,950
What will happen to him?

126
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,850
Justice.

127
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,610
Crime cannot be tolerated.

128
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,430
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

129
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,970
Your parents' death was not your fault.

130
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,360
It was your father's.

131
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,030
Change the fact that your father failed to act.

132
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,270
The man had a gun.

133
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,170
Would that stop you?

134
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,190
I've had training.

135
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,310
The training is nothing.

136
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,770
The will is everything.

137
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,910
The will to act.

138
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:39,220
You haven't beaten me.

139
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,460
You've sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

140
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,980
Rub your chest.

141
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,150
Your arms will take care of themselves.

142
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,470
You're stronger than your father.

143
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,490
You didn't know my father.

144
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,890
But I know the rage that drives you.

145
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,670
That impossible anger strangling the grief

146
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,030
until the memory of your loved one is just poisoning your veins.

147
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,050
And one day you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed,

148
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,810
so you'd be spared your pain.

149
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:36,350
I wasn't always here in the mountains, taken from me.

150
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,930
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency

151
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,170
who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

152
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,780
Your anger gives you great power,

153
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,490
but if you let it, it will destroy you,

154
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,430
as it almost did me.

155
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,030
What stopped it?

156
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:55,950
Vengeance.

157
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,360
That's no help to me.

158
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,070
Why could you not avenge your parents?

159
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,140
Will you be heading back to Princeton

160
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
after the hearing, sir,

161
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,540
or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

162
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm not heading back at all.

163
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,650
You don't like it, do you?

164
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,490
I like it fine.

165
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,590
They just don't feel the same way.

166
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,050
I've prepared the master bedroom.

167
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,090
No.

168
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,640
My room will be fine.

169
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,740
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

170
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,740
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

171
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,200
Your father is dead, Mr. Wayne.

172
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,450
This place is a mausoleum.

173
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,740
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

174
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,340
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

175
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,280
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.

176
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,000
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible

177
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,160
for what was most precious to him in our world.

178
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
Miss Doris has offered her to drive you to the hearing.

179
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,070
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

180
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,510
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

181
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,410
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

182
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,810
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

183
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,940
You haven't given up on me yet.

184
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,180
Never.

185
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,490
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

186
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
Doesn't he notice you're tall enough to reach now?

187
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,800
Well, have us die hard, I guess.

188
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,260
Never used to stop us anyway.

189
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,240
No, I didn't. How's your mom?

190
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,340
She misses this place. So do I.

191
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,610
Yeah. But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

192
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,090
Now there's only Alfred.

193
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,790
And you?

194
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,630
I'm not staying, Rachel.

195
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,990
You're just back for the hearing.

196
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,600
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

197
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,710
Someone had this proceeding. It should stand for my parents.

198
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,250
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

199
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,430
What Chill did is unforgivable

200
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,970
Then why's your boss letting him go?

201
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,330
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone

202
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,690
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole

203
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,860
Rachel, this man killed my bear

204
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,470
I cannot let that pass, and I need you to understand that, please

205
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,190
The Depression hit working people like Mr. Chill hardest of all

206
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,990
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed, but by desperation

207
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,830
and given the 14 years already served

208
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,810
as well as its extraordinary level of cooperation

209
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,010
with one of this office's most important investigations,

210
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,890
we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

211
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,050
Mr. Chiu?

212
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,130
Not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

213
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,630
I'm sure I was desperate, like a lot of people back then,

214
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,690
but they don't change what I did.

215
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,910
I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

216
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,810
Has he got anything to say?

217
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,940
We don't need to see this.

218
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,170
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted on making the hearing public.

219
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,830
Falcone paid him off to get chill out in the open.

220
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,330
Maybe I should be thanking them.

221
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,430
You don't mean that.

222
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,670
What if I do, Rachel?

223
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,850
My parents deserve justice.

224
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,870
You're not talking about justice.

225
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,230
You're talking about revenge.

226
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,490
Sometimes they're the same.

227
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,050
No, they're never the same, Bruce.

228
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,690
Justice is about harmony.

229
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,010
Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

230
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,930
That's why we have an impartial system.

231
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,370
Well, your system is broken.

232
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,900
You care about justice?

233
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,800
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

234
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,220
This city is rotting.

235
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,300
They talk about the Depression as if it's history, and it's not.

236
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,960
Things are worse than ever down here.

237
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,800
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs,

238
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,680
preying on the desperate, creating new Joe chills every day.

239
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,280
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce.

240
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,320
He's destroying everything that they stood for.

241
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,760
You want to thank him for that? Here you go.

242
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,170
We all know where to find him.

243
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,000
But as long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared,

244
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,910
no one will touch him.

245
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,870
If good people like your parents will stand against injustice, they're gone.

246
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,470
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

247
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.

248
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,560
What do you mean?

249
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,090
All these years I wanted to kill him.

250
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,890
Now I can't.

251
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:53,200
I would be ashamed of you.

252
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,010
You look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

253
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,210
No gun. I'm insulted.

254
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,300
You could have just sent a thank you note.

255
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,580
I didn't come here to thank you.

256
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,440
I came here to show you that not everyone at Gotham is afraid of you.

257
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,920
Only those who know me, kid.

258
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,300
Look around you.

259
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,880
You'll see two consulmen.

260
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,310
A union official, a couple off-duty cops, and a judge.

261
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,650
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off right here and right now in front of him.

262
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,310
Now, that's power you can't buy.

263
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,490
That's the power of fear.

264
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,150
I'm not afraid of you.

265
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,270
Because you think you've got nothing to lose.

266
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,530
But you haven't thought it through.

267
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,250
You haven't thought about your lady friend down in the DA's office.

268
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,350
You haven't thought about your old butler.

269
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,170
Bang!

270
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,320
People from your world have so much to lose.

271
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,320
Now you think, because your mommy and your daddy got shot,

272
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,560
you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

273
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,480
You've never tasted desperate.

274
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,000
You're Bruce Wayne, the Prince of Gotham.

275
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,700
You'd have to go a thousand miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

276
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,640
So don't come down here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

277
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,260
This is a world you never understand, and you always fear.

278
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,470
what you don't understand.

279
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.

280
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,920
I'll give you that.

281
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,180
More than your old man, anyway.

282
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,580
In the joint, Chill told me, uh,

283
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,860
told me about the night he killed your parents.

284
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,200
He said your father begged for mercy.

285
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,600
Like a dog.

286
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,420
Should've did better.

287
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,750
For what?

288
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,470
Your jacket.

289
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:54,920
Okay.

290
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,790
Hey, hey, hey.

291
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,250
Let me have some nice coat.

292
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,030
He carefully sees you with that.

293
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,570
They're gonna come looking for me.

294
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:04,970
Who?

295
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:35,440
Everyone, among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

296
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:45,080
The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes, I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

297
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,980
And when I traveled, I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success.

298
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,960
But I never became one of them.

299
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,260
Fool. What the hell do I care what your name is? You're a criminal.

300
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,340
What was your friend, Yuen?

301
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,140
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

302
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,750
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind, conquer your fears.

303
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,740
The criminal is not complicated.

304
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,510
What you really fear is inside yourself.

305
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,680
You fear your own power.

306
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
You fear your anger.

307
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,080
The drive to do great or terrible things.

308
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:45,450
Now, when he inwards, breathe.

309
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,960
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

310
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
You must bask in the fear of other men.

311
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,970
And men fear most what they cannot see.

312
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,200
You have to become a terrible thought.

313
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:53,890
You have to become an idea!

314
00:33:54,230 --> 00:36:06,870
You have to lead these men.

315
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,430
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to...

316
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,120
I avoid!

317
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:49,760
...but to fight criminals, this man is a murderer.

318
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,390
He's married.

319
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,230
By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats?

320
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,070
Criminals mock society's laws.

321
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,030
You know there's better than most.

322
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,450
are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

323
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,140
Or would I be leading these men?

324
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,590
To strike at the heart of criminality.

325
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,610
Gotham's time has come.

326
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,160
Like Constantinople or Rome before it.

327
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,300
The city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

328
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,440
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

329
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,970
This is the most important function of the league.

330
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,540
It is one we performed for centuries.

331
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,070
I will tell him you said he's alive.

332
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,700
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

333
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,640
Yes, I have.

334
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,860
You look very fashionable.

335
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,530
Apart from the mud.

336
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,290
Were you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

337
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,180
As long as it takes.

338
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,020
I'm going to show the people of Gotham their city doesn't belong to the criminals.

339
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,470
In the Depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises combating poverty.

340
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,330
He believed that his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

341
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,090
Did it?

342
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,640
In a way, their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

343
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,350
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy,

344
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,730
and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

345
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,680
As a man, I'm flesh and blood.

346
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,080
I can be ignored, I can be destroyed, but as a symbol,

347
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,390
as a symbol, I can be everlasting.

348
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:20,950
What symbol?

349
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,270
Something.

350
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,560
I assume that as you're taking on the underworld,

351
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,540
this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals.

352
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,040
You thinking about Rachel?

353
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,540
Hey, Rita, I was thinking of myself.

354
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,550
You told anyone I'm coming back?

355
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,930
I just couldn't figure.

356
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,990
The legal ramifications are bringing you back from the dead.

357
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:46,590
Dead?

358
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,230
You've been gone seven years.

359
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,630
You had me declared dead?

360
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,590
Well, actually, it was Mr. Earl. He's taking the company public.

361
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,170
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

362
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,690
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

363
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,120
Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then.

364
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,880
Quite so, sir.

365
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,550
And you can borrow the rolls, if you like.

366
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,090
Just bring it back with a full tank.

367
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:21,270
In my opinion, Mr. Zaz is as much a danger to himself as to others.

368
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:25,270
And prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

369
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,290
Dr. Crane?

370
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:30,990
Oh, Mr. Oz.

371
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,510
You really think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

372
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,370
Well, I would hardly have testified to that otherwise when I missed Oz.

373
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:42,250
This is the third of Carmine Falcone's thugs you had declared insane and moved into your asylum.

374
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,070
Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

375
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,610
Or the corrupt.

376
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,830
Mr. Finch, I think you should check with Miss Dawes here

377
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,450
just what implications your office has authorized her to make.

378
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:00,670
If any.

379
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,020
What are you doing, Rachel?

380
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,220
What are you doing, Carl?

381
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,640
Looking out for you.

382
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,110
Falcone is half the city.

383
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,410
Bought and paid for.

384
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,650
How can you say that?

385
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,710
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone,

386
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,910
I care more about you.

387
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,190
That's sweet.

388
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,710
Bless you, Pat.

389
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,230
They get some.

390
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,170
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

391
00:44:59,890 --> 00:47:05,550
Don't you mind, Doc? I'm bringing in the shipments.

392
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,330
We are paying you for that.

393
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,190
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as Favis.

394
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,900
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falco.

395
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,360
But you know who I'm working for.

396
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,120
And when he gets here...

397
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,640
He's coming to Gotham?

398
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,660
Yes, he is.

399
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,600
And when he gets here, he's not going to want to hear that you have endangered our operation

400
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,920
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

401
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,170
Who's bothering you?

402
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,190
There's a girl at the DA's office.

403
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,810
We'll buy a Roth, not this one.

404
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,030
Idealist, huh?

405
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,650
Well, there's an answer to that, too.

406
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,410
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

407
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,210
I don't think that Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy arms manufacture as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

408
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,150
It's 20 years ago.

409
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:11,610
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

410
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,570
Good morning, Mr. Earl's office.

411
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,170
Oh, yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

412
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,290
Good morning.

413
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,690
I'm here to see you, Mr. Earl.

414
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:21,690
Name?

415
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,830
Bruce Wayne.

416
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,850
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public,

417
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:34,150
but that is what we as responsible managers are going to do.

418
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,680
Jessica.

419
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,420
Jessica, where are you?

420
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,490
I want to answer your phone.

421
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,850
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earl. I'm sure they'll call back.

422
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,350
Bruce, you're supposed to be dead.

423
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,670
Sorry to disappoint.

424
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,990
I need you to take a look at this.

425
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,610
Have you seen him yet?

426
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,150
Who?

427
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,190
Wayne.

428
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,510
He's been over the news.

429
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:00,630
He's back.

430
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,800
I'm sure you realize I can't stop.

431
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,940
Big machine, too many wheels turning.

432
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,760
We're going public.

433
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:10,740
I understand.

434
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,080
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

435
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,100
I'm not looking to interfere.

436
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,920
I am looking for a job.

437
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,620
Oh?

438
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,580
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.

439
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,880
Any ideas where you would start?

440
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,780
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

441
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,160
Fox Department.

442
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,190
I let him know you're coming.

443
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,020
You look like him.

444
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,700
Yeah, your dad.

445
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,860
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

446
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,780
This is where you belong.

447
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,190
Welcome home.

448
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,310
Environmental procedures, defense projects,

449
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,270
consumer products,

450
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,620
all prototypes.

451
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,320
Not in production.

452
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,700
On any level whatsoever.

453
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:53,940
None.

454
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,900
What did they tell you this place was?

455
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,400
They didn't tell me anything.

456
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,500
Earl told me exactly what it was

457
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,560
and sent me down here.

458
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,510
Dead end.

459
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,730
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

460
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:14,200
You were on the board?

461
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,820
When your father ran things.

462
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,740
You knew my father?

463
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,280
Oh yeah, helped him build his train.

464
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,940
Oh, here we are.

465
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,040
Kevlar utility harness,

466
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,580
gas powered magnetic grapple gun,

467
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,000
the 350 pound test monofilament.

468
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,970
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

469
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,730
Rided it right into Wayne town,

470
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,090
along with the water and power utilities.

471
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,770
I gotta make Wayne Tower the unofficial senator of Gotham City.

472
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,910
Of course, Earl had to go to the rot. Here we are.

473
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,810
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.

474
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,790
Kevlar bi-weave, reinforced joints.

475
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:56,890
Terror-resistant.

476
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,290
This sucker will stop a knife.

477
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,310
Bulletproof.

478
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,770
Anything but a straight shot.

479
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,490
Why didn't they put it into production?

480
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,970
Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

481
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,970
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

482
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,890
I wanna borrow it for, uh, Spelunky.

483
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:16,770
Spreling.

484
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,770
Yeah, you know cave diving?

485
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,840
You're expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?

486
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,160
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earl didn't know about me borrowing.

487
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,570
Mr. Wayne, the way I see it, all this stuff is yours anyway.

488
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,700
You good? Give it a try.

489
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:50,400
Charming. At least you'll have company.

490
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,460
This must be the lowest foundation of the South East Wing.

491
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:13,150
In the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad,

492
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,390
secretly transporting three slaves to the North.

493
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,130
And I suspect these cabins came in handy.

494
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,160
I can see everything arrived from down here, sir. Thank you very much.

495
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,050
Part of this cow from Singapore...

496
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,410
...by a dummy corporation.

497
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:08,730
Indeed. And then quite separately, we place an order through a Chinese company for these.

498
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,050
Put it together ourselves.

499
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:11,870
Precisely.

500
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,640
There'll have to be large orders to avoid suspicion.

501
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,270
How large?

502
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,450
Say, 10,000.

503
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,630
Well, at least we'll have spares.

504
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,310
Yes.

505
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,970
Don't suppose you want a taste.

506
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,810
Just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

507
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,010
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flash.

508
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:51,990
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste.

509
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:53,870
Makes us guys nervous.

510
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,130
I'm not a rat.

511
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,270
In a town that's been, who's there to write to anyway?

512
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,250
Don't turn around.

513
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,890
Carmine Falcone brings a shitloads of drugs every week.

514
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:44,970
Nobody takes him down. Why?

515
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,270
He's paid up with the right people.

516
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,550
What will it take to bring him down?

517
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,960
Leverage on Judge Faden.

518
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,790
And a DA right enough to prosecute.

519
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,890
Rachel Dawes.

520
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,470
Who are you?

521
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,310
Watch for my side.

522
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,390
You're just one man.

523
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:49,510
What the hell was that?

524
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,410
Just some nut.

525
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,790
What is it today? More spelonky?

526
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,550
No. Today it's base jumping.

527
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:04,810
Base jumping?

528
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,430
Is that like parachuting?

529
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,180
Kinda. Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

530
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,460
You know, I think I have just a thing.

531
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,320
It's called memory cloth.

532
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,280
Notice anything?

533
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,720
Regularly flexible.

534
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:31,040
But put a current through it, molecules realign, it becomes rigid.

535
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,620
What kind of shapes can you make?

536
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,620
It can be tailored to fit in any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

537
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,080
Too expensive for the Army?

538
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,740
I don't think they ever tried to market it to the billionaire's belonging base dumping crowd.

539
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,120
Look, Mr. Fox.

540
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:43,640
Yes, sir?

541
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,160
If you're uncomfortable...

542
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,500
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

543
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,970
But don't think of me as an idiot.

544
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:01,960
What's that?

545
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,020
Want a tumbler?

546
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:17,510
It was built as a bridging vehicle.

547
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,730
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, throwing caves.

548
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,240
And over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

549
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,240
This will boost you into a rampless jump.

550
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:32,980
No, no!

551
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,290
Disengaged.

552
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:47,710
We never could get the damn bridge to work, but this baby works just fine.

553
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:48,570
No!

554
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,250
So what do you think?

555
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,010
Does it come in black?

556
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,570
I need you at the docks Thursday.

557
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:05,930
Problems?

558
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,290
I don't want any trouble with the last shipment.

559
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:08,910
Sure.

560
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,810
We're on the street is you gotta beef with somebody in the DA's office.

561
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,350
That's not right.

562
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:19,990
And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

563
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,050
So what's your point, Mr. Flass?

564
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,610
Have you seen the girl?

565
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,050
It's a cute little assistant DA.

566
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,350
I think it's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe.

567
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,090
Even for this town.

568
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,110
Never underestimate Gotham City.

569
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,070
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

570
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,990
Sometimes, sometimes things just go bad.

571
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:48,270
Sir, the problem with the graphite, sir, the next 10,000 will be up to specifications.

572
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,810
At least they gave us a discount.

573
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,080
Quite.

574
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,260
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing?

575
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,260
On your head.

576
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,910
White bats lost away.

577
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,610
That's frightened me.

578
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,670
This time my enemies shared my dread.

579
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:08,630
What is this?

580
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:13,930
Continue.

581
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,730
Looks fine out there.

582
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,540
Bears, they go straight to the dealers.

583
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,500
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the narrows.

584
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,360
What's the difference?

585
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,300
Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

586
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,000
Don't burden yourself with these secrets of scary people.

587
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,380
Hey, it's Dice.

588
01:00:52,380 --> 01:05:05,530
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

589
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:00,940
Gangs, guardian angels, or the goddamn Salvation Army.

590
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,440
Get them off the street and off the front page.

591
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,060
They say it was just one guy or a creature.

592
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,900
What's some asshole in the costume?

593
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,240
This guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime lords.

594
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,400
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

595
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:18,730
Understand?

596
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,670
No way to bury it now.

597
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,210
Maybe so, but they're still Judge Faden.

598
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:23,070
Got Faden covered.

599
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:25,650
Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

600
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:30,350
Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat, we've got Balconi at the scene.

601
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:34,210
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

602
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,370
Okay, let's do it.

603
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,250
Bats are nocturnal.

604
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:45,470
Bats may be, but even for billionaire playboys, three o'clock is pushing it.

605
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,470
Price for leading a double life, I fear.

606
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,180
Your theatrics made an impression.

607
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,420
Metricality, deception.

608
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,600
They're powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

609
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,620
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come, it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

610
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,460
Polo, for instance.

611
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,060
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

612
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,600
Strange injuries and non-existent social life.

613
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:19,880
These things beg the question as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

614
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,680
What does someone like me do?

615
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,200
Drive sports cars.

616
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,120
Take movie stars.

617
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,400
Buy things that are not for sale.

618
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,000
Who knows, Master Wayne?

619
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,630
You start pretending to have fun, you might even have a little by accident.

620
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,210
Sir, we have a situation.

621
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:42,510
All right.

622
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:46,630
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.

623
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,330
Heavily damaged, all crew missing.

624
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:50,930
Probably dead.

625
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,590
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.

626
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,170
It's a microwave emitter.

627
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,650
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

628
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:09,970
It looks like somebody, um, turned it on.

629
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,510
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

630
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,490
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

631
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,140
The weapon itself is, um...

632
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,430
Missing?

633
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:37,479
Yeah.

634
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,210
I've seen another one.

635
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,380
He's done something the police have never done.

636
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,760
You can't take the law into your own hands.

637
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,840
At least he's getting something dumb.

638
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,920
Bruce, help me out here.

639
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:12,319
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

640
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,740
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

641
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,399
And now the cops want to bring him in, so what does that tell you?

642
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,140
They're jealous.

643
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,100
Sir, the pool is for decoration and your friends do not have swim room.

644
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,529
Well, they're European.

645
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,830
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

646
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,930
It is not a question of money.

647
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:45,890
You see, I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

648
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,490
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

649
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,790
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

650
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:03,170
Bruce?

651
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,160
Rachel?

652
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,840
I heard you were back.

653
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:13,850
What are you doing?

654
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,050
Uh, just swimming.

655
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,770
Wow, it is good to see you.

656
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,030
You were gone a long time.

657
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,850
I know. How are things?

658
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,860
Same. Job's getting worse.

659
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,860
Can't change the world on your own.

660
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,680
What choice do I have?

661
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,750
When you're too busy swimming.

662
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,950
Rachel, all of... all this...

663
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:49,260
It's not me. It's... inside. I am...

664
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:06,430
Bruce, deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

665
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,310
But it's not who you are underneath.

666
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,590
It's what you do that defines you.

667
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,010
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

668
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:30,830
Not at all. He cut his wrists.

669
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,910
Probably looking for the insanity plea.

670
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,930
But if anything should happen...

671
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:36,810
Of course. Better safe than sorry.

672
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,700
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

673
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,180
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

674
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,520
Not a couple of days of this food.

675
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,620
It'll be true.

676
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,200
What do you want?

677
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,840
I want to know how you're going to convince me to keep my mouth shut.

678
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:56,640
About what?

679
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:57,960
You don't know anything.

680
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,900
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

681
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,080
I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nuthouse.

682
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,220
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

683
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,520
You know, those goons you used.

684
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,020
I own the muscle in this town.

685
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,640
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months.

686
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,860
So whatever he's planning, it's big.

687
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,200
And I want it.

688
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,910
Well, I already know what he'll say.

689
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,540
That we should kill you.

690
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,970
Even he can't get me in here.

691
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:35,510
Not in my town.

692
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,230
Would you like to see my mask?

693
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,150
I use it in my experiments.

694
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,050
He's probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

695
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:54,940
With these crazies.

696
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,320
He can't stand it.

697
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,350
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

698
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,550
They scream and they cry.

699
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,210
Which is your game now?

700
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,730
He's not faking. Not that one.

701
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,340
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham.

702
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,660
I can't treat him here.

703
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,450
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

704
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,890
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks for the Falcone.

705
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,210
Oh, he Moonlights is a low level enforcer.

706
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,750
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

707
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,390
Why? What about the other half?

708
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:02,750
The Flask knows.

709
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:03,790
He won't talk.

710
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,070
He'll talk to me.

711
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,750
Mission Love set up a massive task force to catch you.

712
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:11,390
He thinks you're dangerous.

713
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:12,790
What do you think?

714
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,880
I think you're trying to help.

715
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,230
But I've been wrong before.

716
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,230
Man, I have kids to feed.

717
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,690
Do I don't like falafel?

718
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,650
Where were the other drugs going?

719
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:01,350
I never knew. I don't know. I swear to God.

720
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,350
Swear to me!

721
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:11,270
I don't know. I never knew. Never.

722
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,930
They went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealer.

723
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:15,390
Why?

724
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,140
There was something. Something else in the drugs.

725
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,220
Something hidden. What?

726
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,040
I never went to the drop-off point.

727
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,900
It was in the narrows. Cops only go there when they're in force.

728
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,380
Do I look like a cop?

729
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,060
Stop it!

730
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:46,090
What am I talking about?

731
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,260
What's your problem with it?

732
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,010
It shouldn't exist.

733
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:53,310
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

734
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,810
So I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

735
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:59,030
Listen, counselor, we don't want to know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

736
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,130
Things are working a little differently now.

737
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,290
Open it up.

738
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:57,910
It's you, isn't it?

739
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,870
Everybody's been talking about you.

740
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,130
Don't get in here!

741
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,320
The other kids won't believe me.

742
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:29,010
Bit of all traces.

743
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,730
Gonna torch the whole place.

744
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:32,370
All right.

745
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:02,050
It's your birthday.

746
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,150
This was so much more potent.

747
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:16,830
Hallucinogen.

748
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,530
Weaponized in aerosol form.

749
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,390
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

750
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,890
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

751
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:30,630
I analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

752
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,050
I'm not going to understand any of that.

753
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:34,030
Not at all.

754
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:36,810
I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

755
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,610
Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.

756
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,630
Could you make more?

757
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,030
Are you planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

758
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,550
You know how it is, Mr. Fox.

759
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,150
You're out at night looking for kicks.

760
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,850
Someone's passing around the weaponized to loosen the jets.

761
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:51,090
I'll bring what I have.

762
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,130
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

763
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,230
Alfred, always a pleasure.

764
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:03,600
Lucius, you sure you don't want to come in?

765
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:04,840
I have to get back.

766
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,560
I just wanted to leave this.

767
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:06,980
Thank you.

768
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,400
Rachel?

769
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,390
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

770
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:14,510
Must have been quite an occasion.

771
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,580
It is my birthday.

772
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,450
I know.

773
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,750
I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present.

774
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,670
You've got better plans?

775
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,470
My boss has been missing for two days,

776
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:27,370
which in this town means that I should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.

777
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:27,830
Rachel.

778
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,590
Rachel Doss.

779
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:34,830
Who authorized that?

780
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,550
Get Crane down there right now. Do not take no for an answer.

781
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,990
Call Dr. Lehman. Tell him we'll need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.

782
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:42,210
What's wrong?

783
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:46,270
It's Falcone. Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

784
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,070
You're going to Arkham now. It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

785
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,760
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

786
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,860
Some of us have work to do.

787
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,080
You be careful.

788
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,260
With Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

789
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,680
Keep them happy until I arrive.

790
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,400
Tell them that joke, you know.

791
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,170
What's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

792
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:11,910
I need some information.

793
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:16,910
The Wayne Antwerp 47B-1-M-E.

794
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,080
It's a microwave emitter.

795
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,620
It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

796
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:28,380
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air,

797
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:30,100
but isn't that illegal?

798
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:36,290
I want all the information on the development of this project.

799
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:40,310
All data, files, backup disks on my desk right away.

800
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:41,730
Did you lose one?

801
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:45,900
I'm merging your department with archives.

802
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:20,810
This is most irregular. I have nothing further to add to the report I filed with the judge.

803
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,370
I have questions about your report.

804
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:23,290
Such as?

805
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,950
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness

806
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,510
to suddenly have a complete psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

807
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,670
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

808
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,940
What's Scarecrow?

809
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,840
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia on an external tormentor,

810
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,860
usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.

811
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,980
In this case, a Scarecrow.

812
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,580
He's drugged?

813
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,020
Psychopharmacology is my primary.

814
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,360
I'm a strong advocate.

815
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:03,730
Outside, he was a giant.

816
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,590
In here, only the mind can grant you power.

817
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:08,690
You enjoy the reversal.

818
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,410
I respect the mind's power over the body.

819
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,740
It's why I do what I do.

820
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:18,240
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars and not in therapy.

821
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,960
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone, including blood work.

822
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,140
Find out what exactly you put him on.

823
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,300
First thing tomorrow, then.

824
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,120
Tonight.

825
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,320
I've already paged Dr. Laman at County General.

826
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:34,530
As you wish.

827
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,050
This way, please.

828
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,750
There's something I think you should see.

829
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,250
This is where we make the medicine.

830
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,970
Perhaps you should have something to clear your head.

831
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:54,190
What do we do?

832
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:57,130
What anyone do, or comes around.

833
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:01,810
You want the cops here?

834
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:04,350
At this point, they can't stop us.

835
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,370
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

836
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:11,450
Force him outside, the police will take him down.

837
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:12,990
What about her?

838
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,470
She hasn't got law.

839
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,250
I give her a concentrated dose.

840
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:18,490
The mind can only take so much.

841
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:23,380
Go the things they say about him

842
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,160
Can you really fly I heard he can disappear?

843
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,520
Well, we'll find out

844
01:27:31,800 --> 01:29:30,950
Won't we he isn't here right now. I'll go in now. I'll be right behind you sir

845
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,640
What's on the way?

846
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:35,930
Hey

847
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:32,270
Dusing dogs in we get it down to the medics they can't help her but I can

848
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,420
Talks in hidden inside Falcone's drugs and then dumping into the water supply

849
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:53,990
Why? What was he planning?

850
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:54,710
I don't know.

851
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,150
Was he working for Falcone?

852
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,410
He meant to someone else. Someone worse.

853
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,670
I need to get her the antidote before the damage becomes permanent.

854
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,850
How long does she have?

855
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:03,450
Not long.

856
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,070
What is that?

857
01:31:09,590 --> 01:32:40,370
We gotta go.

858
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:43,940
I'll get my car.

859
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:45,680
I brought mine.

860
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,440
Yours.

861
01:32:58,130 --> 01:32:59,630
I gotta get me one of those.

862
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,230
He is in a vehicle.

863
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,290
Make it color.

864
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,910
It's a black...

865
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:07,460
Tank!

866
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,540
Stay calm.

867
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:11,640
You've been poisoned.

868
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,030
I'm on him.

869
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:14,110
Notify the water company.

870
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,190
There's got to be a way of isolating the areas.

871
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:18,270
No, you don't understand.

872
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,980
They put it all in.

873
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,580
They must have been at this for weeks.

874
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,400
The captain's entire water supplies laced with it.

875
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,500
Why haven't we felt the effects?

876
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,600
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

877
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,280
How do you feel?

878
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,600
Why did you bring me here?

879
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,640
If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

880
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,020
You were poisoned.

881
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:08,540
This...

882
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:19,880
This Dr. Crane...

883
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:19,900
Rest.

884
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:26,470
Gordon has Crane.

885
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,540
I'm sorry.

886
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:27,590
I'm sorry.

887
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:28,730
I'm sorry.

888
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:30,070
I'm sorry.

889
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:31,570
I'm sorry.

890
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:32,120
I'm sorry.

891
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:32,250
I'm sorry.

892
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:34,410
Gordon has cream.

893
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,060
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

894
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,060
I don't have the luxury of friends.

895
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,170
I'm going to give you a sedative.

896
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,420
You'll wake up back at home.

897
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,680
When you do, get these to Gordon.

898
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:48,420
And Gordon alone trusts no one.

899
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,380
What are they?

900
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,360
The antidote.

901
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,480
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

902
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,080
Mass production.

903
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,960
Cream was just a pawn.

904
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,800
We need to be ready.

905
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,640
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham,

906
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,340
The only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats

907
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,860
was when you said that it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

908
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:34,620
It's not.

909
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,480
What would you call that?

910
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:39,950
Damn good television.

911
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:41,830
It's a miracle no one was killed.

912
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,770
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

913
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:48,070
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

914
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:53,550
I'm using this monster to help other people just like my father did.

915
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:57,130
But Thomas Wayne helping others wasn't about proving anything to anyone,

916
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:58,210
including himself.

917
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,310
It's Rachel, Alfred.

918
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:02,010
She was dying.

919
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,110
She's downstairs sedated.

920
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:05,270
I need you to take her home.

921
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,090
Well, we both care for Rachel, sir.

922
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:09,250
But what you're doing has to be beyond that.

923
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,450
It can't be personal.

924
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:12,170
Well, you're just vigilante.

925
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:13,370
Is Fox still here?

926
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,210
Yes, sir.

927
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:16,090
We need to send these people away now.

928
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:18,310
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests out there, sir.

929
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,610
You have a name to maintain.

930
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:21,290
I don't care about my name.

931
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,710
It's not just your name, sir.

932
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:24,770
It's your father's name.

933
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,680
And it's all that's left of him.

934
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:31,510
Don't destroy.

935
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,780
Happy birthday, Bruce.

936
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:50,500
Thank you.

937
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:53,670
How'd the stock offering go?

938
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,030
The price is soared.

939
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,050
Who was buying?

940
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:58,550
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

941
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,630
It's a bit technical.

942
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:04,370
The key thing is, our company's future is secure.

943
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,700
What was the plan, Crane?

944
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:33,270
How were you going to get your toxin into the air?

945
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,920
Who were you working for, Crane?

946
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:53,530
Happy birthday, Bruce.

947
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:54,210
Well, thank you.

948
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:54,970
Thanks.

949
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:56,970
And thank you for that item.

950
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:00,050
You're welcome.

951
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:02,190
You're welcome. I know you put it to good use.

952
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:03,170
I already have.

953
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:06,790
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

954
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:09,410
Weeks. Why?

955
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,510
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

956
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:16,060
Water supply won't help you disperse an inhaler.

957
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:23,730
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough to vaporize all the water in the mains.

958
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:28,670
A microwave emitter like the one-way Enterprise is just misplaced.

959
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:30,230
Misplaced?

960
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:33,130
We're all just fired for asking too many questions about it.

961
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,570
I need you to go back to Wayne Enterprises right now and start making more of that antidote.

962
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:42,450
I think the police are going to need as much as they can get their hands on, okay?

963
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:44,910
My security clearance has been revoked.

964
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,370
That won't stop a man like you now, would it?

965
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,450
I suppose not.

966
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:55,440
Bruce, there's somebody here you said we must meet.

967
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,820
Now, am I pronouncing this right?

968
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,340
Mr. Raz al Ghul?

969
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:08,790
No, Raz al Ghul.

970
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:11,830
I watched him die.

971
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:14,290
But is Waraz Al Ghul immortal?

972
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,770
Are his methods supernatural?

973
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:28,890
More cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Raz.

974
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:35,680
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham

975
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,620
wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

976
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,400
He warned you about compassion.

977
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:50,830
The quarrel is with me. You let these people go.

978
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,940
Welcome to explain the situation to them.

979
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:58,320
Everyone?

980
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:00,720
Everybody?

981
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,230
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

982
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:24,170
There's a thing about being a Wayne that you're never short of a few freeloaders like yourselves to fill up your mansion with.

983
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:25,990
So here's to you people.

984
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:26,590
Thank you.

985
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:27,130
That's enough.

986
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:27,630
Awesome.

987
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:29,270
I'm not finished.

988
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:44,110
To all of you, uh, all you phonies, all of you two-faced friends, you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me, please leave me in peace.

989
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:53,370
Please go. Stop smiling. It's not a joke. Please leave. The party's over. Get out.

990
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:57,250
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

991
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:13,390
Amusing, but pointless.

992
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,180
None of these people have longed to live.

993
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,940
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

994
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,620
So Crane was working for you?

995
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:26,080
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

996
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:27,860
He was able to weaponize it.

997
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:30,450
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

998
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:34,290
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

999
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:39,930
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1000
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:44,590
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1001
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,350
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1002
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:02,890
Only a cynical man would call what these people have lie this way.

1003
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:04,490
Crime, despair.

1004
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,230
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1005
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:12,370
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.

1006
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:17,920
We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground.

1007
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,850
ground every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence we return to restore

1008
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:29,490
the balance gotham isn't beyond saving give me more time there are good people here you are

1009
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:51,550
defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure when i found

1010
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:59,210
you in that jail you were lost but i believed in you i took away your fear and i showed you a path

1011
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,570
You are my greatest student.

1012
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,640
It should be you standing by my side saving the world.

1013
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:08,110
I'll be standing where I belong.

1014
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,590
And the people of Gotham.

1015
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:16,430
No one can save Gotham.

1016
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:24,270
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1017
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:30,360
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1018
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,520
The movement back to Harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1019
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,720
You attacked Gotham before.

1020
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:37,420
Of course.

1021
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:40,240
Over the ages, our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1022
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:42,840
With Gotham, we tried a new one, economics.

1023
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,460
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens,

1024
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:50,430
such as your parents.

1025
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,040
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1026
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:01,620
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1027
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:04,600
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself,

1028
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,640
and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1029
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,100
We are back to finish the job.

1030
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,900
At this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1031
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:16,500
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1032
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,600
If someone stands in the way of true justice,

1033
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,940
you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1034
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,510
We never did learn to mind your surroundings.

1035
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,230
Justice is balance.

1036
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:40,170
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1037
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:44,130
Consider us even.

1038
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,190
No one comes out. Make sure.

1039
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:16,270
How many from maximum security?

1040
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:19,710
Every one of them. Serial killers, rapists...

1041
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:22,650
Get them to raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.

1042
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:30,190
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges, but I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs that are running loose out there.

1043
01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:30,810
Come on.

1044
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,060
I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

1045
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,230
Faster, wait!

1046
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:13,590
What is the point of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1047
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:36,450
Or maybe you'd like to see some excessive force.

1048
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:36,870
Hey, man!

1049
01:51:36,870 --> 01:51:37,670
Man with your gun.

1050
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:42,610
With residents curious at the unprecedented show

1051
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:44,490
of police strength to round up the enrave,

1052
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,050
the situation is...

1053
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:45,370
Oh, lady!

1054
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:46,930
We're about to raise these bridges.

1055
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:48,730
Officer, I'm a Gotham City District Attorney.

1056
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:49,330
Let me pass.

1057
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,020
Somebody here to see you.

1058
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:05,640
What are you doing here?

1059
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,880
A mutual friend sent me with this counter-x-creant toxin.

1060
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:10,300
Hopefully you won't need it.

1061
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,020
Unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1062
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,500
All right, last one across.

1063
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:24,350
I'd better get you off the island before they raise the bridges.

1064
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:24,990
Patrolman!

1065
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:27,120
Stop!

1066
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,640
I can't find my mom.

1067
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:13,150
Gentlemen, time to spread the word.

1068
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:16,700
And the word turns.

1069
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:45,720
Spiking.

1070
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:47,550
Right there.

1071
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,730
That water main is right under the Narrows.

1072
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:45,390
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1073
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:46,390
This is just the beginning.

1074
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:48,190
If they hit the whole city with Toxin,

1075
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:51,170
There's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart from mass panic.

1076
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:52,130
How are they gonna do that?

1077
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:53,150
They'll be using the train.

1078
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:57,130
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1079
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,090
If they get their machine into Wayne Station,

1080
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:02,570
it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the entire city's water supply.

1081
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:04,650
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1082
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:07,590
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.

1083
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:08,670
What do you need?

1084
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:09,750
Can you drive stick?

1085
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:21,280
Nothing to fear, but fear itself.

1086
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:24,210
I can hear the hell!

1087
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:57,760
They will save us.

1088
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:05,330
Luke, don't peek.

1089
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,450
Mrs. Gordon, prepare to lower the bridge.

1090
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:35,950
You could die. At least tell me your name.

1091
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:48,120
It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.

1092
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,120
Bruce?

1093
01:57:51,780 --> 01:58:27,870
You took my advice about theatricality a bit? Literally.

1094
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:29,130
It ends here.

1095
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:33,030
But you and the police, maybe. My fate, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1096
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:35,600
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.

1097
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:38,130
I can't beat two of your pawns.

1098
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:39,530
As you wish.

1099
01:58:53,470 --> 01:59:03,440
GPS online. It's in 100 yards.

1100
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:18,300
I seem to remember firing you. You did. I got another job. Yours.

1101
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,840
Who's authority?

1102
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:26,510
Batman may have made the front page, but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page 8.

1103
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:34,880
Bruce Wayne?

1104
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:38,880
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1105
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,480
Well, the fact that I'm the owner.

1106
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:41,560
What are you talking about?

1107
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:45,740
The company went public a week ago, and I bought most of the shares.

1108
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:49,200
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1109
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:55,100
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing is that my company's future.

1110
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:57,750
Right, Mr. Fox?

1111
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:59,450
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1112
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:03,530
Didn't you get the memo?

1113
02:06:04,130 --> 02:06:24,790
I didn't tell you, Rachel.

1114
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:27,070
No, no, Bruce. I'm sorry.

1115
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:30,710
The day that Chill died, I...

1116
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,510
I said terrible things.

1117
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:36,050
But true things.

1118
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:39,300
I was a coward with a gun.

1119
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:42,460
Justice is about more than revenge, so...

1120
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,320
Thank you.

1121
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,390
I never stopped thinking about you.

1122
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:49,530
About us.

1123
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:52,640
When I heard you were back, I...

1124
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:54,970
I started to hope.

1125
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,040
Then I found out about your mask.

1126
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:36,860
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1127
02:07:38,510 --> 02:07:39,390
A man I loved.

1128
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,910
A man who vanished.

1129
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:45,030
He never came back at all.

1130
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:14,010
Prove me wrong, you know.

1131
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:14,950
About what?

1132
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:20,190
Father would be very proud of you.

1133
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,080
Just like me.

1134
02:08:50,030 --> 02:08:50,750
What will you do?

1135
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,850
Rebuild it.

1136
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:57,310
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1137
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:05,960
Just the way it was, sir?

1138
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:08,840
Yeah, why?

1139
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:13,900
I thought this might be a good opportunity for improving the foundations.

1140
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,380
In the southeast corner.

1141
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,180
Precisely, sir.

1142
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:36,780
I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1143
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:38,490
Well, Sergeant.

1144
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:40,270
Oh, it's Lieutenant now.

1145
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,010
You really started something.

1146
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:44,110
Bent cops running scared.

1147
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:45,710
Hope on the streets.

1148
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:46,590
But?

1149
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:48,830
The Narrows is lost.

1150
02:09:50,510 --> 02:09:53,890
I still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1151
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:55,530
We will.

1152
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:57,890
We can bring government.

1153
02:09:58,650 --> 02:09:59,690
What about escalation?

1154
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:00,710
Escalation.

1155
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:04,830
We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics.

1156
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:07,470
We start wearing Kevlar.

1157
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:09,790
They buy armor-piercing rounds.

1158
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:10,790
And...

1159
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,870
And you're wearing a mask.

1160
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,700
Jumping off rooftops.

1161
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,040
Take this guy.

1162
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:21,040
Arm robbery, double homicide.

1163
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:24,860
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1164
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,360
Leaves a calling card.

1165
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:39,590
I never said thank you.
