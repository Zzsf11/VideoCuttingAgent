1
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,880
To be continued...

2
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,960
Rachel, let me see.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,700
Can I see?

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,440
Finders keepers and I found it in my garden

5
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,440
Finders keepers

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,020
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,700
Mom! It's your outfit!

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,280
Oh.

9
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,420
Ah!

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,960
Did you have a dream?

11
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,720
Nightmare.

12
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,460
Waste on this place.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,460
I'm going to fight you.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,500
Again?

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,780
Until I kill you.

16
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,480
Can they kill me before breakfast?

17
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,980
You are in hell, Lichaman.

18
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,900
And I am the devil.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,140
You're not the devil.

20
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,900
You're practice.

21
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,400
Hey! Hey!

22
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,500
Solitary!

23
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,870
Why?

24
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,900
For protection!

25
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I don't need protection.

26
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,440
Protection for them.

27
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,480
Duty!

28
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,960
Are you so desperate to fight criminals

29
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,720
that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?

30
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,240
Actually, there were seven of them.

31
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,220
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

32
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
How do you know my name?

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,400
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear.

34
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,840
No matter how deeply it chooses to sink.

35
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,220
Who are you?

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,900
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Raz Al Ghul,

37
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,519
a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

38
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,300
A man who can offer you a path.

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,720
At least you think I need a path.

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Someone like you is only here by choice.

41
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,700
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity, but whatever your original intentions, you have become truly lost.

42
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,140
On what path then? Ra's al Ghul, Arthur?

43
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,560
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice.

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
The Bath of the League of Shadows.

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
The Vigilantes.

46
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,200
No, no, no. The Vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

47
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,260
He can be destroyed or locked up.

48
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,410
But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal,

49
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,380
to you. And if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely.

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,760
Which is? Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,010
Tomorrow you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with petty thieves and want

52
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,320
to achieve something, there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick

53
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,020
one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what

54
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
you were looking for in the first place.

55
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,320
And what was I looking for?

56
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,780
Only you can know that.

57
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,540
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,160
Your time is back.

60
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,640
So, please, look back.

61
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,720
Where is our girl?

64
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,420
Wait.

65
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,560
What are you seeking?

66
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,020
I seek...

67
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,900
the means to fight injustice.

68
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,260
To turn fear...

69
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,299
against those who prey on the fearful.

70
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,020
To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own.

71
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,020
Are you ready to begin?

72
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,080
I can barely stand.

73
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,080
Death does not wait for you to be ready.

74
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,660
Death is not considerate warfare.

75
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,000
And make no mistake, here you face death.

76
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,300
Tiger.

77
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,600
Jujutsu.

78
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,320
Panzer.

79
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,780
You're skilled. This is not a dance.

80
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,380
And you are afraid.

81
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,760
But not of me.

82
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,800
Tell us, Mr. Wayne.

83
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,900
What do you fear?

84
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:17,800
Bruce.

85
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,060
It's okay.

86
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,180
It's okay.

87
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,040
You'll be okay.

88
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,120
We'll be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne.

89
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.

90
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,480
Very good, sir.

91
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm very sorry, sir.

92
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,400
Don't worry, it's fine.

93
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,080
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

94
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,620
And why did we fall, Bruce?

95
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,880
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

96
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,620
The bats again.

97
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,680
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

98
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,500
They were afraid of you.

99
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,820
Afraid of who?

100
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,340
All creatures feel fear.

101
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,140
Even the scary ones?

102
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,060
Especially the scary ones.

103
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,660
I got something to show you.

104
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,780
You think your mother will like him?

105
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:26,820
Yeah.

106
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,700
I think it's time to get up.

107
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,440
Maybe.

108
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm going back to bed.

109
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
Did you build this train, Dad?

110
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,820
Gotham's been good to our family.

111
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,020
But the city's been suffering.

112
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,400
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

113
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,740
So we built a new, cheap public transportation system to unite the city.

114
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,600
And at the center?

115
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
Wayne Tower.

116
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Is that where you work?

117
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,530
No, I work at the hospital.

118
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,740
I lead the running of our company to much better men.

119
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,580
Better?

120
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,440
Well, more interested men.

121
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:15,880

123
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,140
Go.

124
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,160
Go.

125
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,140
Please.

126
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,140
Let's go.

127
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,100
What's wrong, Bruce?

128
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,580
No, no, it was me.

129
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,620
I just needed some fresh air.

130
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,360
A little bit of opera goes a long way.

131
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,460
Right, Bruce?

132
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,580
Come on.

133
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,860
Let's go.

134
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,360
Wallace.

135
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,000
Joey.

136
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,000
Come on, fast.

137
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,800
That's fine.

138
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,160
Fast.

139
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,500
Take it easy.

140
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,560
Take it easy.

141
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
Here you go.

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,460
It's fine. It's fine.

143
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,120
Now just take it and go.

144
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,420
I said you were...

145
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,620
I need you!

146
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,840
Shut up!

147
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,200
Bruce.

148
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,660
It's okay.

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Don't be afraid.

150
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
Is this your father's?

151
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,020
It's okay.

152
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,180
Come here.

153
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,800
There you go.

154
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,040
It's okay.

155
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,780
It's okay.

156
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Go ahead.

157
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,960
Hey.

158
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,460
Good news.

159
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,400
We got him, son.

160
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,940
You're in excellent hands.

161
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,400
We'll be watching the Empire.

162
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,960
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

163
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:20,700
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

164
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,900
Very well.

165
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:28,880
Alfred.

166
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
Yes, Master Bruce?

167
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,480
It was my fault, Alfred.

168
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,960
I made the thief appear.

169
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,440
No, no, no.

170
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,740
If my handgun skipped.

171
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,220
It was nothing that you did.

172
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,080
It was him and him alone.

173
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,940
Do you understand?

174
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,780
I miss him Alfred. I miss him so much.

175
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,380
So do I Master Bruce.

176
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,380
So do I.

177
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,740
Do you still feel responsible for your parents dad?

178
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
My anger outweighs my guilt.

179
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,339
Come.

180
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,380
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

181
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,660
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

182
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,099
You know how to fight six men.

183
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,140
We can teach you how to engage 600.

184
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,720
You know how to disappear.

185
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,880
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

186
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,040
Invisible?

187
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,020
Abhi!

188
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,600
Ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

189
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,040
Always mind your surroundings.

190
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,020
Ninjutsu employs explosive powders.

191
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,350
as weapons or distractions theatricality and deception are powerful agents you must become

192
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:19,290
more than just a man in the mind of your opponent who is he he was a farmer and he tried to take

193
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,660
his neighbor's land and became a murderer now he is a prisoner what will happen to him justice

194
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,140
crime cannot be tolerated criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding

195
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,940
Your parents death was not your fault.

196
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,320
It was your father's.

197
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,920
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

198
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,200
The man had a gun.

199
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,080
Would that stop you?

200
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,140
I've had training.

201
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,240
The training is nothing.

202
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,620
The will is nothing.

203
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
The will to act.

204
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,280
Yield.

205
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,140
You haven't beaten me.

206
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,360
You've sacrificed your footing for a killing stroke.

207
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
Rub your chest.

208
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,000
Your arms will take care of themselves.

209
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,380
You're stronger than your father.

210
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,400
You didn't know my father.

211
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,800
But I know the rage that drives you.

212
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,680
That impossible anger strangling the grief until the memory of your loved one is just

213
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
poisoning your veins

214
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,940
One day you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed

215
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,740
So you'll be spared your pain

216
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,240
I wasn't always here in the mountains

217
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,400
Once I had a wife

218
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,220
My great love

219
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,280
She was taken from me.

220
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,840
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency

221
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,100
who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

222
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,760
Your anger gives you great power.

223
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,400
But if you let it, it will destroy you.

224
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,360
As it almost did me.

225
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,980
What stopped it?

226
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,880
Vengeance.

227
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,280
That's no help to me.

228
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,900
Why, Bruce?

229
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,040
Why could you not avenge your parents?

230
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,620
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir?

231
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,480
Or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

232
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm not heading back at all.

233
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,560
You don't like it, do you?

234
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,400
I like it fine.

235
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,540
I just don't feel the same way.

236
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,040
I've prepared the master bedroom.

237
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,040
No.

238
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,390
My room will be fine.

239
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,680
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

240
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,660
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

241
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,210
Your father is dead, Master Wayne.

242
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,330
This place is a mausoleum.

243
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,580
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

244
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,700
This house, Master Wayne,

245
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,320
has sheltered six generations of your family.

246
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,060
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?

247
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,180
It's not your family.

248
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,080
I give a damn

249
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,840
because a good man once made me responsible

250
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,540
for what was most precious to him

251
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,020
in our world.

252
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,840
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

253
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,020
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

254
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,380
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

255
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,380
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

256
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,720
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

257
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,840
You haven't given up on me yet?

258
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,120
Never.

259
00:22:59,920 --> 00:22:59,980
I love you.

260
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:10,440
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

261
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,040
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?

262
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,740
Well, have as thy heart, I guess.

263
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,240
Never used to stop us anyway.

264
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,140
No, it didn't. How's your mom?

265
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,020
She misses this place.

266
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,240
So do I.

267
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:26,960
Yeah.

268
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,540
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

269
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,980
Now there's only Alfred.

270
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,700
And you?

271
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm not staying, Rachel.

272
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,920
You're just back for the hearing.

273
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,560
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

274
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,600
Someone at this proceeding should stand for my parents.

275
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,160
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

276
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,360
What Jill did is unforgivable.

277
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,900
Then why's your boss letting him go?

278
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,200
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

279
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,620
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

280
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,980
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

281
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,460
I cannot let that pass, and I need you to understand that, please.

282
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,240
Okay.

283
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,080
The Depression hit working people like Mr. Chill hardest of all.

284
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,960
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

285
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,960
And given the 14 years already served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation with one of this office's most important investigations,

286
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,820
we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

287
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,900
Mr. Chill?

288
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,080
Your Honor, not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

289
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,540
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then,

290
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,540
but that don't change what I did.

291
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,860
I gather there's a member of the Wayne family here today.

292
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,720
Has he got anything to say?

293
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,360
Coming out the side.

294
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
Coming out the side, guys.

295
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,920
Hey, Joe.

296
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,700
Don't call this his car.

297
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,740
Oh, Bruce.

298
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,820
We don't need to see this.

299
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,140
I do.

300
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,280
The D.A. couldn't understand why Judge Faden

301
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,120
insisted on making the hearing public.

302
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,760
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

303
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,280
Maybe I should be thanking them.

304
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,300
You don't mean that.

305
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,560
What if I do, Rachel?

306
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,700
My parents deserve justice.

307
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,700
You're not talking about justice.

308
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,060
You're talking about revenge.

309
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,400
Sometimes they're the same.

310
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,020
No, they're never the same, Bruce.

311
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,560
Justice is about harmony.

312
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,940
Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

313
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,840
That is why we have an impartial system.

314
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,260
Well, your system is broken.

315
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
You care about justice?

316
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,720
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

317
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
This city is rotting.

318
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,220
They talk about the Depression as if it's history, and it's not.

319
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,940
Things are worse than ever down here.

320
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,660
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs, preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

321
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,180
You know, Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce.

322
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,240
But he's destroying everything that they stood for.

323
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,660
You want to thank him for that? Here you go.

324
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,140
We all know where to find him.

325
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,770
But as long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one will touch him.

326
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,820
If good people like your parents will stand against injustice, they're gone.

327
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,440
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

328
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.

329
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,500
What do you mean?

330
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,040
All these years I wanted to kill him.

331
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,820
Now I can't.

332
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,640
Your father would be ashamed of you.

333
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:39,000
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

334
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,900
No gun. I'm insulted.

335
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,110
You could have just sent a thank you note.

336
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,520
I didn't come here to thank you.

337
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,400
I came here to show you that not everyone at Gotham's afraid of you.

338
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,820
Only those who know me, kid.

339
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,220
Look around you.

340
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,180
You'll see two consulmen, a union official, a couple off-duty cops, and a judge.

341
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,620
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation in blowing your head off right here and right now in front of them.

342
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,200
Now, that's power you can't buy.

343
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,380
That's the power of fear.

344
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,080
I'm not afraid of you.

345
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,200
Because you think you've got nothing to lose.

346
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,500
But you haven't thought it through.

347
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,160
You haven't thought about your lady friend down in the DA's office.

348
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,300
You haven't thought about your old butler.

349
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,060
Bang!

350
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,220
People from your world have so much to lose.

351
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,260
Now you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot,

352
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,500
you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

353
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,360
You've never tasted desperate.

354
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,940
You're Bruce Wayne, the Prince of Gotham.

355
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,640
you'd have to go a thousand miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

356
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,260
So don't come down here with your anger,

357
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
trying to prove something to yourself.

358
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,400
This is a world you'll never understand,

359
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,360
and you always fear what you don't understand.

360
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,080
All right.

361
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that.

362
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,160
More than your old man, anyway.

363
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,420
In the joint, Chill told me, uh,

364
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,780
told me about the night he killed your parents.

365
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,140
They said your father begged for mercy.

366
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,340
Begged.

367
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,540
Like a dog.

368
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,320
Should've did better.

369
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm gonna go.

370
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,340
What?

371
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,420
Your jacket.

372
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,700
Okay.

373
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,200
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have some nice clothes.

374
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,940
Be careful he sees you with that.

375
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,360
They're gonna come looking for me.

376
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:04,800
Who?

377
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,000
Everyone.

378
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,940
Some nice clothes.

379
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,400
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

380
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,480
The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

381
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,060
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

382
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,820
And when I traveled, I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success.

383
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,940
But I never became one of them.

384
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,220
Fool, what the hell do I care what your name is? You're a criminal.

385
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,060
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

386
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,720
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

387
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,680
But the criminal is not complicated.

388
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,400
What you really fear is inside yourself.

389
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,660
You fear your own power.

390
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,100
You fear your anger, the drive to do great or terrible things.

391
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,080
Now you must journey inwards.

392
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,660
You are ready.

393
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,460
Breathe.

394
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,500
Breathe.

395
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,000
Breathe in your fears.

396
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,080
Face them.

397
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,880
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

398
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,740
You must bask in the fear of other men.

399
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,860
And men fear most what they cannot see.

400
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,140
You have to become a terrible thought.

401
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,620
A wraith.

402
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,680
You have to become an idea!

403
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:04,320
Feel Terra cloud your senses.

404
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,500
Feel its power to distort.

405
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,360
To control.

406
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,800
And know that this power can be yours.

407
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,960
Embrace your worst fear.

408
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,679
Become one with the darkness.

409
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:04,480
Focus.

410
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,140
Concentrate.

411
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,880
Master your senses.

412
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,600
You cannot leave any sign.

413
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,300
I haven't.

414
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Impressive.

415
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,620
Agatero Taveroso.

416
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,980
We have purged your fear.

417
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,820
You are ready to lead these men.

418
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,560
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.

419
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,640
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

420
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:17,960
I will.

421
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm no executioner.

422
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

423
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,280
That's why it's so important.

424
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,190
It separates us from them.

425
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,740
You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.

426
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,880
This man should be tried.

427
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,120
By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats?

428
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,900
Criminals mock society's laws.

429
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,960
You know those better than most.

430
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,240
You cannot lead these men unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

431
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,040
Where would I be leading these men?

432
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,240
Gotham. As Gotham's favored son.

433
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,420
You will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

434
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:18,720
How?

435
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
Gotham's time has come.

436
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,060
Like Constantinople or Rome before it.

437
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,200
The city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

438
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,120
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

439
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,760
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.

440
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,460
It is one we performed for centuries.

441
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,200
Gotham must be destroyed.

442
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,760
You can't believe in us.

443
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,740
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.

444
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.

445
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,020
I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this, but I will not become an executioner.

446
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,500
Bruce, please. For your own sake, there is no turning back.

447
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,690
What are you doing?

448
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,020
It was necessary, my friend.

449
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,860
Oh, my God.

451
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:06,960
I will tell him you said he's alive.

452
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,640
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

453
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,560
Yes, I have.

454
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,760
You look very fashionable.

455
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,440
Apart from the mud.

456
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,240
Were you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

457
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,080
As long as it takes.

458
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm going to show the people of Gotham

459
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,660
their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.

460
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,490
In the Depression,

461
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,280
your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises

462
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,420
combating poverty.

463
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,900
He believed that his example could inspire

464
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,280
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

465
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,000
Did it?

466
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:56,640
Anyway,

467
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,100
their murder shot the wealthy

468
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,600
and the powerful into action.

469
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,900
People need dramatic examples

470
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,240
to shake them out of apathy,

471
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,720
and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

472
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,640
As a man, I'm flesh and blood.

473
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,240
I can be ignored, I can be destroyed,

474
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,200
but as a symbol...

475
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,780
as a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

476
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,500
I can be everlasting.

477
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:20,880
What symbol?

478
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,440
Something...

479
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,560
elemental, something terrifying.

480
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,620
I assume that as you're taking on the Underworld,

481
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,420
this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals.

482
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,940
You thinking about Rachel?

483
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,360
Rachel, you tell. I was thinking of myself.

484
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,440
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

485
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,900
I just couldn't figure.

486
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,000
The legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

487
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,600
Dead?

488
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,240
You've been gone seven years.

489
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,250
You have me declared dead?

490
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,400
Well, actually, it was Mr. Earl. He's taking the company public.

491
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,620
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

492
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,520
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

493
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,100
Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then.

494
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,840
Quite so, sir.

495
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,440
And you can borrow the rolls if you like.

496
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,060
Just bring it back with a full tank.

497
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,200
In my opinion, Mr. Zaz is as much a danger to himself as to others.

498
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,980
And prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

499
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,220
Dr. Crane?

500
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,900
Ah, Mr. Oz.

501
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,480
You really think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

502
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,340
I only would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I, Miss Dawes?

503
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,180
This is the third of Carmine Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane and moved into your asylum.

504
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,960
Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

505
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,540
Or the corrupt.

506
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,770
Mr. Finch, I think you should check with Miss Dawes here

507
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,360
just what implications your office has authorized her to make.

508
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:00,580
If any.

509
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,960
What are you doing, Rachel?

510
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,060
What are you doing, Carl?

511
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,620
Looking out for you.

512
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,080
Falcone has half the city.

513
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,300
Bought and paid for.

514
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,290
Drop it.

515
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,580
How can you say that?

516
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,620
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone,

517
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,840
I care more about you.

518
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,140
That's sweet.

519
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,380
We've been through all that.

520
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,080
Bless it, Badagetsu.

521
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,120
It nests somewhere in the grounds.

522
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,040
I don't know.

523
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:25,500
Thank you.

524
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,020
Thank you.

525
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,640
No more favors. Someone is sniffing around.

526
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,980
Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, Doc.

527
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,460
I'm bringing in the shipments.

528
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,220
We are paying you for that.

529
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,960
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.

530
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,920
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

531
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,280
But you know who I'm working for.

532
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,940
And when he gets here...

533
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,560
He's coming to Gotham?

534
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,560
Yes, he is.

535
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,420
And when he gets here, he's not going to want to hear that you have endangered our operation

536
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,920
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

537
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,140
Who's bothering you?

538
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,140
There's a girl at the DA's office.

539
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,940
Well, buy her off.

540
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,760
Not this one.

541
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,940
Idealist, huh?

542
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,580
Well, there's an answer to that, too.

543
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,940
I don't want to know.

544
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:46,740
Yes, you do.

545
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,360
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

546
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,080
I don't think that Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy arms manufacture as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

547
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,020
That's 20 years ago.

548
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,000
Fred Bates.

549
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,560
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

550
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,500
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

551
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,140
Oh yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

552
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,620
Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earl.

553
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,620
Name?

554
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,800
Bruce Wayne.

555
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,800
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public,

556
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,080
but that is what we as responsible managers are going to do.

557
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,640
Jessica.

558
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,360
Jessica, where are you?

559
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,500
I am the ball, and no one answering the phone.

560
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,740
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earl. I'm sure they'll call back.

561
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,300
Bruce, you're supposed to be dead.

562
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,560
Sorry to disappoint.

563
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,920
I need you to take a look at this.

564
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,560
Have you seen him yet?

565
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,100
Who?

566
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,560
Wayne. He's been over the news. He's back.

567
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,700
I'm sure he realized I can't stop.

568
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,720
Big machine, too many wheels turning. We're going public.

569
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,640
I understand.

570
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,980
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

571
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,940
I'm not looking to interfere.

572
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,860
I am looking for a job.

573
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,540
Oh?

574
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,520
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.

575
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,780
Any ideas where you would start?

576
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,720
Applied sciences caught my eye.

577
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,020
Fox Department.

578
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,160
I'll let him know you're coming.

579
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,920
You look like him.

580
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,660
Yeah, your dad.

581
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,880
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

582
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,660
This is where you belong.

583
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,120
Welcome home.

584
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,180
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.

585
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,680
All prototypes. Not in production. On any level whatsoever.

586
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:53,880
None.

587
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,760
What did they tell you this place was?

588
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,320
They didn't tell me anything.

589
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,500
They all told me exactly what it was when they sent me down here.

590
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,400
Dead End.

591
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,700
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

592
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,040
Come on.

593
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,100
You were on the board?

594
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,820
When your father ran things.

595
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,620
You knew my father?

596
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,520
Oh yeah.

597
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,200
Helped him build his train.

598
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,840
Ah, here we are.

599
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,920
Kevlar utility harness, gas powered magnetic grapple gun, the 350 pound test monofilament.

600
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,820
Wonderful project, you're dad's brain.

601
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,920
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.

602
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,720
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

603
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,820
Of course, Earl had to build a rot. Here we are.

604
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,640
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.

605
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,800
Kevlar bi-weave, reinforced joints.

606
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,800
Terror resistant.

607
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,220
This sucker will stop a knife.

608
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,180
Bulletproof.

609
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,640
Anything but a straight shot.

610
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,920
Why didn't they put it into production being counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand

611
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:07,960
So

612
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,920
What's your interest in it? Mr. Wayne? I want to borrow it for

613
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:14,820
Spelunky

614
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,740
Yeah, you know cave diving

615
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,820
Expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves

616
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,600
Look I'd rather mr. Earl didn't know about me bar Mr. Wayne

617
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,560
I mean, the way I see it, all this stuff is yours anyway.

618
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,600
You good? Give it a try.

619
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,440
Charming.

620
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,380
At least you'll have company.

621
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,400
This must be the lowest foundation of the Southeast Wing.

622
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,100
In the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad,

623
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,290
secretly transporting free slaves to the North.

624
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,080
And I suspect these cabins came in handy.

625
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:37,400
I can see everything all right from down here, sir.

626
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,020
Thank you very much.

627
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,710
We ordered a main part of this car from Singapore.

628
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,400
Via dummy corporation.

629
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,160
Indeed.

630
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,680
Then quite separately, we place an order to a Chinese company for these.

631
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,360
Put it together ourselves.

632
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,780
Precisely.

633
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,320
There'll have to be large orders to avoid suspicion.

634
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,240
How large?

635
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,500
Say, 10,000.

636
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,200
Well, at least we'll have spares.

637
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,020
Yes.

638
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,160
Don't suppose you want a taste

639
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,720
Just keep offering

640
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,880
Thinking maybe someday you'll get wise

641
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flash

642
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,400
What, Jimbo, you don't take the taste?

643
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,960
Makes us guys nervous

644
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm not rad

645
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,280
In a town this big, who's that a ride to anyway?

646
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,100
Don't turn around.

647
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,760
You're a good cop.

648
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,760
One of the few.

649
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,460
What do you want?

650
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,860
Carmine Falcone brings a shipments of drugs every week.

651
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,880
Nobody takes him down. Why?

652
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,260
He's paid up with the right people.

653
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,560
What will it take to bring him down?

654
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,900
Leverage on Judge Faden.

655
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,660
And a DA brave enough to prosecute.

656
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,840
Rachel Dawes.

657
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,400
Who are you?

658
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,180
Watch for my side.

659
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,300
You're just one man.

660
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,740
Now we're two.

661
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:12,860
We.

662
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:30,080
Freeze!

663
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,380
What the hell was that?

664
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,360
Just some nut.

665
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,140
Well, what is it today?

666
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,540
Morse belonging?

667
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,300
No.

668
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,480
Today it's base jumping.

669
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,470
Base jumping?

670
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,840
Is that like parachuting?

671
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,500
Kinda.

672
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,520
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

673
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,220
You know, I think I have just the thing.

674
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,260
It's called memory cloth.

675
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,240
Notice anything?

676
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,480
Regularly flexible.

677
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:23,540
It's clearly flexible.

678
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,620
But put a current through it...

679
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,960
Molecules realign, become rigid.

680
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,560
What kind of shapes can you make?

681
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,560
It can be tailored to fit in any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

682
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,060
Too expensive for the army?

683
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,040
Right, I don't think they ever tried to market it to the billionaires

684
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,660
belonging to the base dumping ground.

685
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Look, Mr. Fox.

686
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,620
Yes, sir?

687
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,980
If you're uncomfortable...

688
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,580
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing

689
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,440
When I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

690
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,880
But don't think of me as an idiot.

691
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,980
Fair enough.

692
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,860
What's that?

693
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,920
The tumbler?

694
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,160
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

695
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,500
She was built as a ranging vehicle.

696
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,740
In combat, two of these would jump over a river towing cables.

697
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,200
And over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

698
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,220
This will boost you into a rampless jump.

699
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,900
Not now!

700
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,100
Disengaged.

701
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,620
We never could get the damn bridge to work, but this baby works just fine.

702
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,200
So what do you think?

703
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,980
Does it come in black?

704
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,440
I need you at the docks. Thursday.

705
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:05,900
Problems?

706
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,260
I don't want any trouble with the last shipment.

707
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:08,840
Sure.

708
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,740
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

709
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,300
That's not right.

710
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,960
And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

711
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,960
So what's your point, Mr. Flass?

712
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,560
Have you seen the girl?

713
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,860
It's a cute little sister dear.

714
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Do you think it's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe?

715
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,020
Even for this town.

716
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,080
Never underestimate Gotham City.

717
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,980
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

718
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,940
Sometimes, sometimes things just go bad.

719
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,810
Sir, problem with the graphite, sir.

720
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,140
The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.

721
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,700
At least they gave us a discount.

722
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,040
Quite.

723
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,200
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?

724
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:34,700
Why bats?

725
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,900
Lost the way?

726
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,480
That's frightened me.

727
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,560
This time my enemies shared my dread.

728
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,600
What is this?

729
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:13,840
Continue

730
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,760
Looks fine out there

731
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:30,220
Bears they go straight to the dealers. Yeah, the rabbits go to the man in the narrows. What's the difference? Ignorance is bliss my friend

732
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,980
Don't burden yourself with these secrets of scary people

733
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,180
Hey.

734
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,180
Stay.

735
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:14,680
Stays?

736
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:27,900
What?

737
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,120
What?

738
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,220
Better check it.

739
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,360
There's a problem out here. You better bail.

740
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,030
Where are you?

741
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,160
Here.

742
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:40,400
Oh

743
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:13,040
What the hell are you?

744
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,320
I'm Batman.

745
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,780
Nice coat.

746
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,380
Thanks.

747
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:07,940
Oh, my God.

748
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,000
Hold it.

749
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,280
That's right. You better run.

750
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,840
Falcone sent them to kill you.

751
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,330
Why?

752
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,120
He rattled his cage.

753
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,180
What's this?

754
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,090
Leverage.

755
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,660
For what?

756
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:39,800
To get things moving.

757
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,060
Who are you?

758
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,700
Someone like you.

759
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,660
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

760
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:51,560
Ma'am?

761
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,340
Everything okay?

762
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,680
Malcony's men.

763
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:00,640
Does it matter?

764
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,880
We'll never turn to it anyway.

765
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,460
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

766
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,080
What the hell is that?

767
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,380
Cut him down.

768
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,220
Unacceptable.

769
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,960
I don't care if it's rival gangs, guardian angels,

770
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,880
or the goddamn Salvation Army.

771
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,340
Get them off the street and off the front page.

772
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,860
They say it was just one guy.

773
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:05,980
Or a creature.

774
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,820
Or some asshole in a costume.

775
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:09,940
Yeah.

776
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,100
This guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime wards.

777
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,320
No one takes the bar into their own hands in my city.

778
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:18,620
Understand?

779
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,520
No way to bury it now.

780
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,160
Maybe so, but there's still Judge Faden.

781
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,040
We've got Faden covered.

782
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,480
Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

783
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,280
Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat, we've got Balcony at the scene.

784
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,100
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

785
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,300
Okay, let's do it.

786
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,180
Bats are nocturnal.

787
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,480
Bats may be, but even for a billionaire playboy,

788
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,420
three o'clock is pushing it.

789
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,400
Price for leading a double life, I fear.

790
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,140
Your theatrics made an impression.

791
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,980
Theatricality, deception.

792
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,440
They're powerful weapons, Alfred.

793
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,360
This is a good start.

794
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,580
If those are to be the first of many injuries to Carl,

795
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,500
With many injuries to come, it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

796
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,420
Polo, for instance.

797
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,980
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

798
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:13,560
Strange injuries, a non-existent social life.

799
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,820
These things beg the question as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

800
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,600
What does someone like me do?

801
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:29,340
Drive sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale.

802
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:35,540
Who knows, Master Wayne? You start pretending to have fun, you might even have a little by accident.

803
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,140
Sir, we have a situation.

804
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:42,360
Alright.

805
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,580
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.

806
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,880
Heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.

807
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:58,090
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.

808
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,380
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

809
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,540
It looks like somebody...

810
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,940
turned it on.

811
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,500
It uses focus microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

812
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,220
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

813
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,479
The weapon itself is, um...

814
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,399
Missing?

815
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:37,420
Yeah.

816
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:40,819
That's pretty good.

817
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:46,000
Nice car.

818
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,100
We should see another one.

819
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,340
He's done something the police have never done.

820
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,720
You can't take the law into your own hands.

821
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,700
At least he's getting something done.

822
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,899
Bruce, help me out here.

823
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,720
Well, the guy dresses up like a bat.

824
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,160
Clearly has issues.

825
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,660
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

826
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,500
And now the cops want to bring him in.

827
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,340
So what does that tell you?

828
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,080
They're jealous.

829
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:25,120
Sir, the pool is for decoration and your friends do not have swimming rooms.

830
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,340
Well, they're European.

831
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,720
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

832
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,819
It is not a question of money.

833
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:45,819
You see, I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

834
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:50,420
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

835
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,740
And a straight jacket to pin it on.

836
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,000
Bruce?

837
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,100
Rachel?

838
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,740
I'd heard you were back.

839
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,740
What are you doing?

840
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,000
Uh, just swimming.

841
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,660
Wow, it is good to see you.

842
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,040
You're gone a long time.

843
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,860
I know. How are things?

844
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:24,680
Same.

845
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,840
Job's getting worse.

846
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,820
Can't change the world on your own.

847
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,580
What choice do I have?

848
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,560
When you're too busy swimming.

849
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,640
Rachel, all of...

850
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,600
all this...

851
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,580
It's not me.

852
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:45,960
It's...

853
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,080
Inside, I am...

854
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:51,980
I am more.

855
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,920
Come on, Bruce, come!

856
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,960
We have to go to the hotel, you'll be in too far!

857
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:00,960
Bruce...

858
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,360
Deep down, you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

859
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,260
But it's not who you are underneath.

860
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,560
It's what you do that defines you.

861
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,400
I'm sorry.

862
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:16,560
I'm sorry.

863
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,440
I'm sorry.

864
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,440
I'm sorry.

865
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:19,580
I'm sorry.

866
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:20,720
I'm sorry.

867
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:22,700
I'm sorry.

868
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,760
I'm sorry.

869
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:23,800
I'm sorry.

870
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,040
I'm sorry.

871
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:24,940
I'm sorry.

872
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,780
I'm sorry.

873
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,500
I'm sorry.

874
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:28,540
I'm sorry.

875
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,280
I'm sorry.

876
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,320
I'm sorry.

877
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:31,900
I'm sorry.

878
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:33,760
I'm sorry.

879
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:33,960
I'm sorry.

880
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,240
I'm sorry.

881
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,100
I'm sorry.

882
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,520
I'm sorry.

883
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:37,560
I'm sorry.

884
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,560
I'm sorry.

885
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:39,600
I'm sorry.

886
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,640
I'm sorry.

887
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,060
I'm sorry.

888
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,160
I'm sorry.

889
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,260
I'm sorry.

890
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,140
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

891
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,560
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

892
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,060
What do you want?

893
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,680
I want to know how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

894
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,900
About what? You don't know anything.

895
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,800
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

896
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,940
I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

897
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,160
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

898
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:15,960
And those goons you used, I own the muscle in this town.

899
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,500
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months.

900
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,820
So whatever he's planning, it's big.

901
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,080
And I want it.

902
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,820
Well, I already know what he'll say.

903
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,520
That we should kill you.

904
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,920
Even he can't get me in here.

905
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,480
Not in my town.

906
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,060
Would you like to see my mask?

907
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,100
I use it in my experiments.

908
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,140
I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

909
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,160
But these crazies, you can't stand it.

910
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,320
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

911
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
They scream and they cry.

912
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,060
Which is your game now?

913
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,600
Well, he's not faking.

914
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,720
Not that one.

915
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,610
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him

916
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,250
moved to the secure wing at Arkham.

917
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,580
I can't treat him here.

918
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,540
Storm's coming.

919
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,360
Scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

920
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,860
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

921
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,180
Harley Moonlight's is a low-level enforcer.

922
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,680
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

923
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,340
Why? What about the other half?

924
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,640
Vlas knows.

925
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:03,700
He won't talk.

926
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,820
He'll talk to me.

927
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:05,960
to me.

928
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,680
The mission of love set up a massive task force to catch you.

929
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,380
He thinks you're dangerous.

930
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,720
What do you think?

931
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,780
I think you're trying to help.

932
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,160
But I've been wrong before.

933
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,820
Come on, let's go.

934
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,120
I have kids to feed.

935
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
What, only falafel?

936
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,600
Where were the other drugs going?

937
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,320
I never knew. I don't know. I swear to God.

938
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,040
Swear to me!

939
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:11,220
I don't know. I never knew. Never.

940
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,860
They went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealer.

941
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:15,280
Why?

942
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:21,520
There was something. Something else in the drugs. Something hidden.

943
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:21,930
What?

944
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:25,700
I never went to the drop-off point. It was in the narrows.

945
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,880
Cops only go there when they're in force.

946
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,320
Do I look like a cop?

947
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,300
BABYLON!

948
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,020
This is the one I'm talking about.

949
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,180
What's your problem with it?

950
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,920
It shouldn't exist.

951
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,240
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

952
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,780
So I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

953
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,940
Listen, Counselor, we don't want to know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

954
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,100
Things are working a little differently now.

955
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,220
Open it up.

956
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,620
What the hell is this?

957
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:37,100
I'm sorry.

958
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,880
It's you, isn't it?

959
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,840
Everybody's been talking about you.

960
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,240
The other kids won't believe me.

961
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,940
Get rid of all traces.

962
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,560
I'm gonna torch the whole place.

963
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,320
All right.

964
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,160
Oh, having trouble?

965
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,640
Take a seat. Have a drink.

966
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,480
You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.

967
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:17,840
I agree.

968
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,380
Well, in my opinion, you need to lighten up.

969
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,340
Oh, man.

970
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,380
Help me!

971
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,660
Take this poison.

972
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,760
My poison.

973
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,120
My poison.

974
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,540
Rose.

975
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:41,560
Rose.

976
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,360
Why do we fall?

977
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:58,600
How long was that out?

978
01:19:59,360 --> 01:19:59,800
Two days.

979
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:01,940
It's your birthday.

980
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,260
Many happy returns.

981
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,320
I've felt these effects before.

982
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,100
This was so much more potent.

983
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,760
Some kind of hallucinogen.

984
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,480
weaponized in aerosol form.

985
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,340
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

986
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,820
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

987
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:30,620
I analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds in the protein-based catalyst.

988
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,960
I meant I understand any of that.

989
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,660
Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

990
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,520
Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.

991
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,400
Could you make more?

992
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,000
You're planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

993
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,520
Well, you know how it is, Mr. Fox.

994
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,080
You're out at night looking for kicks.

995
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,660
Someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens.

996
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,020
I'll bring what I have.

997
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,060
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

998
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,200
Alfred, always a pleasure.

999
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:56,900
Lucius.

1000
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,540
You sure you don't want to come in?

1001
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,660
I have to get back.

1002
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,350
I just wanted to leave this.

1003
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:06,790
Thank you.

1004
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:07,340
Rachel?

1005
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,340
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

1006
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,320
Must have been quite an occasion.

1007
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,740
It is my birthday.

1008
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:16,360
I know.

1009
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,340
I'm sorry I can't come tonight.

1010
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,700
I was just dropping off your present.

1011
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,580
You've got better plans?

1012
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,380
My boss has been missing for two days,

1013
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,880
which in this town means that I should probably start

1014
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,280
by looking at the bottom of the river.

1015
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:27,720
Rachel.

1016
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:28,840
Excuse me.

1017
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:32,520
Rachel Doss.

1018
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,720
Who authorized that?

1019
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,280
Get Crane down there right now.

1020
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,440
Do not take no for an answer.

1021
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,360
Call Dr. Lehman.

1022
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,520
Tell him we'll need our own assessment

1023
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,920
on the judge's desk by morning.

1024
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,140
What's wrong?

1025
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,220
It's Falcone.

1026
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,160
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

1027
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,980
You're going to Arkham now. It's on the narrows, Rachel.

1028
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,720
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

1029
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,840
Some of us have work to do.

1030
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,040
You be careful.

1031
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:57,840
Happy birthday.

1032
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:20,180
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

1033
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,560
Keep them happy until I arrive.

1034
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,320
Tell them that joke, you know.

1035
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:03,900
Having fun?

1036
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,460
Bill?

1037
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,080
What's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

1038
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,720
I need some information.

1039
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:16,620
The Wayne Enterprise 47B-1ME.

1040
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:18,900
1ME.

1041
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,000
It's a microwave emitter.

1042
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,540
It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

1043
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,250
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air,

1044
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,000
but isn't that illegal?

1045
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,180
I want all the information on the development of this project.

1046
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:40,240
All data, piles, backup disks on my desk right away.

1047
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,660
Did you lose one?

1048
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,740
I'm merging your department with archives.

1049
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,660
And I'm firing you.

1050
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,940
Did you get the memo?

1051
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,860
Let's get a crow.

1052
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:06,760
Get a crow.

1053
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,670
I have nothing further to add to the report I filed with the judge.

1054
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,300
I have questions about your report.

1055
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,220
Such as?

1056
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,780
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness

1057
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:31,450
to suddenly have a complete psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

1058
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:35,640
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

1059
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,840
What's scarecrow?

1060
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,160
Patients suffering delusional episodes

1061
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,120
often focus their paranoia

1062
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,780
on an external tormentor,

1063
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,100
usually one conforming to Jungian

1064
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:50,800
archetypes.

1065
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,860
In this case, a scarecrow.

1066
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,500
He's drugged?

1067
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,050
Psychopharmacology

1068
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,340
is my primary form.

1069
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,280
I'm a strong advocate.

1070
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,640
Outside, he was a giant.

1071
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:05,720
In here, only the mind

1072
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,520
can grant you power.

1073
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,580
You enjoy the reversal.

1074
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,360
I respect the mind's power over the body.

1075
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,680
It's why I do what I do.

1076
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,220
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

1077
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:23,920
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone, including blood work.

1078
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,080
Find out what exactly you put him on.

1079
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,240
First thing tomorrow, then.

1080
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,100
Tonight.

1081
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,260
I've already paged Dr. Lamanette, County General.

1082
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,500
As you wish.

1083
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:42,020
This way, please.

1084
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,640
There's something I think you should see.

1085
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,220
This is where we make the medicine.

1086
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,600
Perhaps you should have something

1087
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,880
to clear your head.

1088
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,260
I'm not your hater.

1089
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,320
He's here.

1090
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:48,460
Who?

1091
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
The Bat-Man.

1092
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,100
What do we do?

1093
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,980
What anyone does when a Prowler comes around.

1094
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,920
Call the police.

1095
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,740
You want the cops here?

1096
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:04,260
At this point, they can't stop us.

1097
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,220
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

1098
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,400
Force him outside, the police will take him down.

1099
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,920
What about her?

1100
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,420
She hasn't got long.

1101
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,180
I give her a concentrated dose.

1102
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,400
The mind can only take so much.

1103
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,440
Now, go.

1104
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,420
The things they say about him...

1105
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,400
Can he really fly?

1106
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,140
I heard he can disappear.

1107
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,200
Well, we'll find out, won't we?

1108
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,220
Taste of your own medicine, Doctor.

1109
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,560
What have you been doing here?

1110
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,520
Who are you working for?

1111
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:41,460
Roz.

1112
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:45,340
Roz, how cool is that?

1113
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,280
Who are you working for?

1114
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,440
Brain.

1115
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,140
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

1116
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,720
But if you'd like to make an appointment...

1117
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,100
What are you waiting for? Back up.

1118
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:30,900
Back up. The Batman's in there. SWAT's on the way. But if you want to go in now, I'll be right behind you, sir.

1119
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,560
SWAT's on the way.

1120
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:35,680
Hey!

1121
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,100
What's happened to her?

1122
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:27,400
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

1123
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,500
We get her down to the medics.

1124
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,280
They can't help her, but I can.

1125
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,200
Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley on the narrow side.

1126
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:50,040
Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden inside Falcone's drugs.

1127
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,400
in the dumping into the water supply.

1128
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,900
What was he planning?

1129
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:54,620
I don't know.

1130
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,060
Was he working for Falcone?

1131
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,440
He mentioned someone else.

1132
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:58,360
Someone worse.

1133
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,370
I need to get her the antidote

1134
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,620
before the damage becomes permanent.

1135
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:02,720
How long does she have?

1136
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:03,380
Not long.

1137
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:08,960
What is that?

1138
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:11,800
Back up.

1139
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,140
What the hell?

1140
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:15,700
Come on!

1141
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:32,220
Excuse me.

1142
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,700
How is she?

1143
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,280
She's fading. We gotta go.

1144
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:43,860
I'll get my car.

1145
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,420
I brought mine.

1146
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:47,340
Yours.

1147
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,520
I've got to get me one of those.

1148
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,220
He is in a vehicle.

1149
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,240
Make it color.

1150
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,780
It's a black...

1151
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,340
tank.

1152
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,780
Stay calm. You've been poisoned.

1153
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,060
I'm on him.

1154
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,020
Breathe slowly.

1155
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:39,040
Hold on.

1156
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,580
What are you doing?

1157
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,360
Shark guy.

1158
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,180
They're on the ground. Lock that ramp.

1159
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:11,680
I ain't got no way off that roof.

1160
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,420
Turn off your engines.

1161
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:16,160
We have to wait in the car.

1162
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,380
Trust me.

1163
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,820
What in the world is going on here?

1164
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,100
Who is this guy?

1165
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:41,760
Where's he going?

1166
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,560
He's on the roof.

1167
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,160
What street is he taking?

1168
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,150
He's not on a street.

1169
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,280
He's flying on rooftops.

1170
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:42,760
At least tell me what it looks like.

1171
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,240
Never mind.

1172
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,400
Got him.

1173
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,520
Coming right up on his butt.

1174
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,320
We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west.

1175
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,180
Arrow on the ground.

1176
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:38,950
I lost him.

1177
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,780
We've lost visual.

1178
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,100
Exit 9's blocked.

1179
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,350
We'll look back to check the frontage road.

1180
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:44,420
Stoves activated.

1181
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,080
Stay with me.

1182
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,260
What? There he is!

1183
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:15,540
Just hold on.

1184
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:20,440
Rachel!

1185
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:32,480
Tomorrow.

1186
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,800
I'm going to go get him.

1187
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,720
They get any of this crap into the mains?

1188
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:58,660
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:37:58,660 --> 01:37:59,660
Notify the water company.

1190
01:37:59,660 --> 01:37:59,860
There's got to be a way of isolating the areas.

1191
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:02,720
No, you don't understand.

1192
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,170
They put it all in.

1193
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:04,660
They must have been at this for weeks.

1194
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,260
Why haven't we felt the effects?

1195
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,380
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed to the lungs.

1196
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:19,820
How do you feel?

1197
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,320
Where are we?

1198
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:26,520
Why did you bring me here?

1199
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,740
If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1200
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,160
You were poisoned.

1201
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,380
It was... it was Dr. Crane.

1202
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:32,900
Dr. Crane, I...

1203
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,480
Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1204
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,920
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1205
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,940
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1206
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,100
I'm gonna give you a sedative.

1207
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,340
You'll wake up back at home.

1208
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,580
When you do, get these to Gordon.

1209
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,320
And Gordon alone trusts no one.

1210
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,300
What are they?

1211
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,280
The antidote.

1212
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,420
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

1213
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:55,000
Mass production?

1214
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:56,880
Crane was just a pawn.

1215
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,720
We need to be ready.

1216
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:27,580
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham,

1217
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,240
the only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats

1218
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,820
was when you said that it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1219
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:34,580
It's not.

1220
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,360
What would you call that?

1221
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,880
Damn good television.

1222
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,780
It's a miracle no one was killed.

1223
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,720
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

1224
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,020
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

1225
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:53,280
I'm using this monster to help other people just like my father did.

1226
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:57,020
But Thomas Wayne helping others wasn't about proving anything to anyone,

1227
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,140
including himself.

1228
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,260
It's Rachel, Alfred.

1229
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,880
She was dying. She's downstairs sedated.

1230
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:05,220
I need you to take her home.

1231
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,000
Well, we both care for Rachel, sir.

1232
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,200
But what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1233
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,420
It can't be personal.

1234
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,080
Or you're just vigilante.

1235
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,300
Is Fox still here?

1236
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:14,180
Yes, sir.

1237
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,980
We need to send these people away now.

1238
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,260
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests out there, sir.

1239
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,620
You have a name to maintain.

1240
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,300
I don't care about my name.

1241
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,680
It's not just your name, sir.

1242
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,720
It's your father's name.

1243
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,660
And it's all that's left of him.

1244
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,560
Don't destroy it.

1245
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,860
Happy birthday to you.

1246
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,880
Happy birthday to you.

1247
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,360
Happy birthday, dear Bruce.

1248
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,720
Happy birthday to you.

1249
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,160
Mr. Earl.

1250
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,820
Happy birthday, Bruce.

1251
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:50,360
Thank you.

1252
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,580
How'd the stock offering go?

1253
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,980
Prices soared.

1254
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,000
Who was buying?

1255
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,500
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1256
01:40:58,860 --> 01:40:59,620
It's a bit technical.

1257
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,180
The key thing is our company's future is secure.

1258
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:07,160
Great.

1259
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,840
Little the worse for winter, I'm afraid.

1260
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,600
What was the plan, Crane?

1261
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,280
How were you going to get your toxin into the air?

1262
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,920
Scarecrow.

1263
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,860
Scarecrow.

1264
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,840
Who were you working for, Crane?

1265
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,100
Oh, it's too late.

1266
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,060
You can't stop it now.

1267
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:53,320
Happy birthday, Mr.

1268
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,160
Well, thank you.

1269
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:54,870
Thanks.

1270
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:56,900
And thank you for that item.

1271
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:00,060
You're welcome.

1272
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,120
I don't know if you put it to good use.

1273
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,040
I already have.

1274
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:03,820
Hmm?

1275
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,740
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

1276
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:08,810
Weeks.

1277
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:09,340
Why?

1278
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,460
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1279
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:16,000
Water supply won't help you disperse an inhaler.

1280
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,080
What?

1281
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:23,620
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1282
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,540
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1283
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,080
Misplaced?

1284
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:33,040
We're all just fired for asking too many questions about it.

1285
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,000
I need you to go back to Wayne Enterprises right now and start making more of that

1286
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,400
I think the police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on, okay?

1287
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,820
My security clearance has been revoked.

1288
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,280
That won't stop a man like you now, would it?

1289
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:48,380
I suppose not.

1290
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,320
Bruce, there's somebody here you simply must meet.

1291
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,720
Now, am I pronouncing this right?

1292
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,260
Mr. Raz Al Ghul?

1293
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,760
You're not Raz Al Ghul.

1294
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:11,680
I watched him die.

1295
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,000
But his horrors are all mortal.

1296
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,760
Are his methods supernatural?

1297
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,740
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Raz.

1298
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:35,640
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham

1299
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,480
wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1300
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:39,800
I saved your life.

1301
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,820
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1302
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:47,680
Your quarrel was with me.

1303
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,740
You let these people go.

1304
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,880
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1305
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:58,160
Everyone?

1306
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:00,660
Everybody?

1307
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:10,180
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1308
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:13,940
Not really.

1309
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:23,980
There's a thing about being a Wayne that you're never short of a few freeloaders like yourselves to fill up your mansion with.

1310
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,940
So here's to you people.

1311
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:26,370
Thank you.

1312
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:27,000
That's enough.

1313
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,080
I'm not finished.

1314
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:44,000
To all of you, uh, all you phonies, all you two-faced friends, you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me, please leave me in peace.

1315
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,500
Please go.

1316
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,280
Stop smiling. It's not a joke. Please leave. The party's over. Get out.

1317
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,200
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1318
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,280
I'm using, but pointless.

1319
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,180
None of these people have longed to live.

1320
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,900
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1321
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,580
So Crane was working for you.

1322
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:26,040
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1323
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:27,700
He was able to weaponize it.

1324
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,420
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1325
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:34,280
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1326
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,880
But really you are going to release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1327
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,560
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1328
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,320
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1329
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,880
Only a cynical man would call what these people have lives, Wayne.

1330
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:04,280
Crime, despair.

1331
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,100
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1332
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,300
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.

1333
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,280
We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats,

1334
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,960
burned London to the ground.

1335
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,300
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence,

1336
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,340
we return to restore the balance.

1337
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,940
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1338
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,140
Give me more time.

1339
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,180
There are good people here.

1340
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:34,060
You are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1341
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,260
Time to play.

1342
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:52,800
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.

1343
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:54,960
But I believed in you.

1344
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:59,100
I took away your fear and I showed you a path.

1345
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:01,500
You are my greatest student.

1346
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,580
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1347
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,020
I'll be standing where I belong.

1348
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,540
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1349
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,360
No one can save Gotham.

1350
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,200
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1351
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:30,220
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1352
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,460
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1353
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,540
You attacked Gotham before?

1354
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:40,200
Of course. Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1355
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:42,660
With Gotham we tried a new one, economics.

1356
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:47,400
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens.

1357
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,280
Such as your parents.

1358
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,980
Guns down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1359
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,580
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1360
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:06,540
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself, and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1361
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,060
We are back to finish the job.

1362
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:12,840
This time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1363
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,520
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1364
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,580
If someone stands in the way of true justice,

1365
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,900
you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1366
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,430
I am gonna stop you.

1367
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:32,520
I never did learn to mind your surroundings.

1368
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,180
Justice is balance.

1369
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,100
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1370
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,020
Consider us even.

1371
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,380
No one comes out.

1372
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,120
Make sure.

1373
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:13,780
They're all gone?

1374
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,210
How many from maximum security?

1375
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:17,500
Every one of them.

1376
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,580
Serial killers, rapists.

1377
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,800
Get them to raise the bridges.

1378
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,620
We don't want any getting off the island.

1379
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,880
I'll raise the bridges.

1380
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:30,140
But I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs that are running loose out there.

1381
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:30,720
Come on.

1382
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:57,100
I hope you're not a member of the Fibregate.

1383
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,080
Fast away! Fast away!

1384
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:13,540
What is the point of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1385
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:52,200
I'm sorry.

1386
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:59,200
Everything my family, my father built.

1387
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:06,020
The white legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.

1388
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:10,280
I wanted to save Gotham. I failed.

1389
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,960
Why do we fall, sir?

1390
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,880
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

1391
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,660
I just feel like you've given up on me.

1392
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:27,740
Never.

1393
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:33,060
Harassment! I see harassment!

1394
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,210
Well, maybe you'd like to see some excessive force.

1395
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:37,600
Hey, man, with your gun.

1396
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:44,540
With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates...

1397
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,830
Well, lady, we're about to raise these bridges.

1398
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:49,240
Officer, I'm a Gotham City District Attorney. Let me pass.

1399
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,560
Hey, shut up!

1400
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:58,960
Hold it!

1401
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,300
Pull these people back!

1402
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,920
Hey, Gordon, there's somebody here to see you.

1403
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,580
What are you doing here?

1404
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,200
A mutual friend sent me with this.

1405
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,640
Counteract screen's toxic.

1406
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:10,200
Hopefully you won't need it.

1407
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,960
Unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1408
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:16,420
All right, last one across.

1409
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,160
I better get you off the island before they raise the bridges.

1410
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:24,900
Patrolman!

1411
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,060
Stop!

1412
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:26,920
Stop!

1413
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,380
I can't find my mom.

1414
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:56,560
Hey!

1415
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,260
What the hell are you doing?

1416
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:13,100
Gentlemen, time to spread the word.

1417
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,840
And the word is...

1418
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,080
Panic.

1419
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:45,700
Jesus, the pressure, it's spiking.

1420
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,480
Right there.

1421
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,700
That water main is right under the narrows.

1422
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,180
It's okay.

1423
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:26,960
Whoa.

1424
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,220
Good devil.

1425
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,760
Good devil.

1426
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,300
This is Commissioner Hogue.

1427
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,340
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1428
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:46,360
Come on!

1429
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:07,560
Oh, no!

1430
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,460
This is Gordon.

1431
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,540
What the hell is going on in there?

1432
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,960
We need reinforcements.

1433
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,220
Tact team, SWAT, riot cops.

1434
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:14,760
Gordon!

1435
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:18,280
All the city's riot police are on the island with you.

1436
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:20,580
We're getting quickly incapacitated.

1437
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:22,360
It's okay. It's okay.

1438
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,880
No one's gonna hurt you.

1439
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,440
Of course they are!

1440
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:28,280
Crane?

1441
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,300
No. Scarecrow.

1442
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:35,640
Gordon, there's nobody left to send in.

1443
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:38,480
Oh, I'm on my own?

1444
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,280
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1445
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:46,360
This is just the beginning.

1446
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,080
If they hit the whole city with toxin, there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart from mass panic.

1447
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,060
How are they going to do that?

1448
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,100
They'll be using the train.

1449
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:57,040
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1450
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:02,480
If they get their machine into Wayne Station, it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the entire city's water supply.

1451
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,640
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1452
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:07,500
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.

1453
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:08,600
What do you need?

1454
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,660
Can you drive stick?

1455
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:16,680
There you are.

1456
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:18,920
There's nothing to fear.

1457
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,260
But fear itself.

1458
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,840
I can hear them.

1459
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,680
Batman will save us.

1460
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:58,160
Luke.

1461
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,060
Luke.

1462
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,190
Don't peek.

1463
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:06,060
Ah!

1464
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,040
This is Gordon.

1465
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:17,360
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1466
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:24,660
I told you he'd come.

1467
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:31,040
Wait.

1468
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:34,020
You could die.

1469
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:35,940
At least tell me your name.

1470
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:42,960
It's not who I am underneath.

1471
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:45,960
But what I do...

1472
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,940
That defines me.

1473
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,040
Bruce?

1474
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:21,200
I'm sorry.

1475
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:27,800
Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit. Literally.

1476
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,040
It ends here.

1477
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:32,980
For you and the police, maybe. My fate, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1478
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,740
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.

1479
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,420
I can't beat two of your pawns.

1480
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:39,460
As you wish.

1481
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:54,440
GPS online.

1482
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,420
100 yards.

1483
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,480
Who the hell authorized this?

1484
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:17,970
Extend story in town.

1485
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:19,000
Three lines.

1486
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,900
Pressure's moving along the mains, blowing all the pipes.

1487
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:33,640
And if that pressure reaches us, the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!

1488
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:46,580
At the next intersection, turn right.

1489
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,980
You will never learn.

1490
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:27,520
Amelia, don't you have anything new?

1491
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:28,760
How about this?

1492
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:47,800
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1493
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:02,340
Evacuate the building.

1494
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:04,840
We're right on top of the main hub, and it's gonna blow.

1495
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:14,520
Weapons.

1496
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:15,960
More!

1497
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:21,100
Nice ride.

1498
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:50,760
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1499
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:54,200
Come on.

1500
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:01,940
You were just an ordinary man in a cape.

1501
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,480
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,

1502
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,900
and that's why you can't stop this train.

1503
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,100
I'm sure there's a thing about stopping it.

1504
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,100
Yes!

1505
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:26,600
You never learned to mind your surroundings.

1506
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:37,960
You finally learned to do what is necessary.

1507
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,380
I won't kill you.

1508
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,640
But I don't have to save you.

1509
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:21,660
I'm sorry.

1510
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,800
The meeting's already started.

1511
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:05,220
What meeting?

1512
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:10,220
Fox.

1513
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:12,440
I seem to remember firing you.

1514
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:13,800
You did.

1515
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:15,940
I got another job.

1516
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:18,220
Yours.

1517
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,820
Whose authority?

1518
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:26,440
Batman may have made the front page, but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page 8.

1519
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:34,740
Bruce Wayne?

1520
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:38,800
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1521
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,420
Well, the fact that I'm the owner.

1522
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,520
What are you talking about?

1523
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,900
The company went public a week ago.

1524
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,680
And I bought most of the shares.

1525
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:49,140
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1526
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:55,880
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing is that my company's future is secure.

1527
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:57,720
Right, Mr. Fox?

1528
02:05:58,300 --> 02:05:59,400
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1529
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,480
Didn't you get the memo?

1530
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:24,640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.

1531
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,640
No, no, Bruce.

1532
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:26,980
I'm sorry.

1533
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,500
The day that Chill died, I...

1534
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,400
I said terrible things.

1535
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:36,020
But true things.

1536
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:39,200
I was a coward with a gun.

1537
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:43,260
Justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.

1538
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:46,300
I never stopped thinking about you.

1539
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,380
about us.

1540
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,200
And when I heard you were back,

1541
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:54,880
I started to hope.

1542
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:21,760
Then I found out about your mask.

1543
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,520
My mask's just a symbol, Rachel.

1544
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:30,720
No, this is your mask.

1545
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:36,640
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1546
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,120
The man I loved.

1547
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,800
The man who vanished.

1548
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:44,940
He never came back at all.

1549
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:52,000
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.

1550
02:07:55,100 --> 02:08:00,600
Maybe someday when Gotham no longer needs Batman, we'll see him again.

1551
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:13,980
Who's me wrong, you know?

1552
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:14,880
About what?

1553
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,120
My father would be very proud of you.

1554
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,000
Just like me.

1555
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:50,640
What will you do?

1556
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:53,780
Rebuild it.

1557
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:57,180
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1558
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:05,940
Just the way it was, sir?

1559
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:08,780
Yeah, why?

1560
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:13,740
I thought this might be a good opportunity for improving the foundations.

1561
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,360
In the southeast corner.

1562
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,140
Precisely, sir.

1563
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:34,120
Nice.

1564
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,620
I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1565
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:38,420
Well, Sergeant.

1566
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,160
Oh, it's Lieutenant now.

1567
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,820
He really started something.

1568
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,040
Mad cops running scared.

1569
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,660
Hope on the streets.

1570
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:46,560
But?

1571
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:48,740
The Narrows is lost.

1572
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:53,840
I still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1573
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:55,440
We will.

1574
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:58,080
We can bring Gotham back.

1575
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,560
What about Escalation?

1576
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:00,640
Escalation?

1577
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:04,720
We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics.

1578
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,680
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1579
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:15,560
And you're wearing a mask, jumping off rooftops.

1580
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,000
Now take this guy.

1581
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:21,000
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1582
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:24,780
Had a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1583
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,280
Leaves a calling card.

1584
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:33,840
I'll look into it.

1585
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,540
I never said thank you.

1586
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,940
And you'll never have to.

1587
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:30,480
Thank you.

1588
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:00,780
Thank you.

1589
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:15,260
Thank you.

1590
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:41,700
Thank you.

1591
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:30,780
Thank you.
