1
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,700
Does it matter?

2
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,880
We'll never turn to it anyway.

3
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:05,530
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

4
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:20,190
What the hell is that?

5
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:31,430
Cut him down.

6
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,920
Rival gangs, guardian angels, or the goddamn Salvation Army.

7
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,460
Get him off the street and off the front page.

8
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,940
They say it was just one guy.

9
01:06:05,459 --> 01:06:06,040
Or a creature.

10
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,900
What's some asshole in the costume?

11
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:10,110
Yeah.

12
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:14,230
This guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime lords.

13
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,370
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

14
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:18,730
Understand?

15
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,670
No way to bury it now.

16
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,210
Maybe so, but they're still Judge Faden.

17
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,070
Got Faden covered.

18
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,650
Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

19
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,870
Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat,

20
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,350
we've got Falcone at the scene.

21
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,630
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.

22
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,210
This bat character gave us everything.

23
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,370
Okay, let's do it.

24
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,240
Bats are nocturnal.

25
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,740
Bats may be, but even for billionaire playboys,

26
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,480
three o'clock is pushing it.

27
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,470
Price for leading a double life, I fear.

28
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,180
Your theatrics made an impression.

29
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,440
Metricality, deception.

30
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:00,590
Powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

31
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,030
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come,

32
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,610
it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

33
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,490
Polo, for instance.

34
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,070
Not learning polo, Alfred.

35
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:13,590
Strange injuries and non-existent social life.

36
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:19,850
These things beg the question as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money?

37
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,650
What does someone like me do?

38
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:29,370
Oh, drive sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale.

39
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,970
Who knows, Master Wayne?

40
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:35,640
You start pretending to have fun, you might even have a little buy accident.

41
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,220
Sir, we have a situation.

42
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:42,500
All right.

43
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,640
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.

44
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,320
Heavily damaged, all crew missing.

45
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:50,920
Probably dead.

46
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,600
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter. It's designed for desert warfare.

47
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,560
But it...

48
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:09,960
It looks like somebody turned it on.

49
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:19,490
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

50
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:32,370
The damage to the ship was catastrophic. The weapon itself is...

51
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:35,450
Missing?

52
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:37,460
Yeah.

53
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:48,160
I've seen another one.

54
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,400
He's done something the police have never done.

55
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,800
You can't take the law into your own hands.

56
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,840
At least he's getting something done.

57
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,940
Bruce, help me out here.

58
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:07,360
Huh?

59
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,340
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

60
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,680
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

61
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,380
And now the cops want to bring him in, so what does that tell you?

62
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,120
They're jealous.

63
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,100
Sir, the pool is for decoration and your friends do not have swimwear.

64
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,540
Well, they're European.

65
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,760
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

66
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:36,890
It is not a question of money.

67
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:45,890
You see, I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

68
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,500
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

69
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,800
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

70
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,100
Bruce?

71
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,160
Rachel?

72
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,820
I'd heard you were back.

73
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:13,840
What are you doing?

74
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,060
Uh, just swimming.

75
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,740
Wow, it is good to see you.

76
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,080
You were gone a long time.

77
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:22,580
I know.

78
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:23,900
How are things?

79
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:24,840
Same.

80
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:27,870
Job's getting worse.

81
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,850
Can't change the world on your own.

82
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,670
What choice do I have?

83
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,740
When you're too busy swimming.

84
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,790
Rachel, all of...

85
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,730
All this, it's not me.

86
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,970
It's inside. I am.

87
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:06,430
Bruce, deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

88
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,280
But it's not who you are underneath.

89
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,600
It's what you do that defines you.

90
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,020
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

91
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,860
Not at all. He cut his wrists.

92
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,900
Probably looking for the insanity plea.

93
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,640
I learned if anything should happen.

94
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,780
Of course. Better safe than sorry.

95
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:44,730
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

96
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,270
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

97
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,590
A couple of days of this food will be true.

98
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,190
What do you want?

99
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,830
I want to know how you're going to convince me to keep my mouth shut.

100
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:57,990
About what? You don't know anything.

101
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,910
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

102
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:06,070
I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nuthouse.

103
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,210
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

104
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:16,010
And look, those goons you used, I own the muscle in this town.

105
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:19,630
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months.

106
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,890
So, whatever he's planning, it's big.

107
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,210
And I want it.

108
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,950
Well, I already know what he'll say.

109
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,570
That we should kill you.

110
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,990
Even he can't get me in here.

111
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:35,510
Not in my town.

112
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,240
Would you like to see my mask?

113
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,140
I use it in my experiments.

114
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,260
He's probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

115
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,300
With these crazies, he can't stand it.

116
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,360
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

117
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,880
They scream and they cry.

118
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,200
What is your game now?

119
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,780
He's not faking. Not that one.

120
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,340
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham.

121
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,660
I can't treat him here.

122
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,480
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

123
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,980
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

124
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,240
Oh, he Moonlights is a low-level enforcer.

125
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,740
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

126
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,420
Why? What about the other half?

127
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:02,760
Flask knows.

128
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,780
He won't talk.

129
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,070
He'll talk to me.

130
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,730
Mission to love set up a massive task force to catch you.

131
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,410
He thinks you're dangerous.

132
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,810
What do you think?

133
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:15,870
I think you're trying to help.

134
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,180
But I've been wrong before.

135
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,190
I have kids to feed.

136
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:38,670
Do I don't like falafel?

137
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,640
Where were the other drugs going?

138
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,340
I never knew. I don't know. I swear to God.

139
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,240
Swear to me!

140
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,260
I don't know. I never knew. Never.

141
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,920
They went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealer.

142
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:15,480
Why?

143
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,500
There was something. Something else in the drugs. Something hidden.

144
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,920
I never went to the drop off point. It was in the nearest. Cops only go there when they're in force.

145
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,380
Do I look like a cop?

146
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:48,240
That's what I'm talking about. What's your problem with it?

147
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:53,230
It shouldn't exist. This ship left Singapore with 246 containers but arrived with 247.

148
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,790
So I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

149
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:59,030
Listen, counselor, we don't want to know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
